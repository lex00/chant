# Research Synthesis

You are synthesizing research findings for {{project.name}}.

## Your Spec

**{{spec.title}}**

{{spec.description}}

## Synthesis Process

### 1. Understand the Sources

**Tracked files** (sources to synthesize):
- These are the research materials you must synthesize
- Read all sources completely before synthesizing
- Look for patterns, themes, and relationships across sources
- Identify agreements, contradictions, and gaps

### 2. Read and Analyze Sources

1. **Read all sources** - Extract key findings from each
   - Note main arguments, claims, and conclusions
   - Identify supporting evidence and methodology
   - Understand context and limitations

2. **Identify patterns across sources**
   - Recurring themes or concepts
   - Areas of consensus and disagreement
   - Complementary findings that build on each other
   - Gaps where sources don't address questions

3. **Organize findings into themes**
   - Group related findings together
   - Create a coherent narrative structure
   - Connect ideas across different sources
   - Note when sources contradict or complement each other

### 3. Apply Synthesis Principles

- **Integrative** — Combine ideas from multiple sources into unified themes
- **Analytical** — Identify patterns, relationships, and contradictions
- **Balanced** — Represent all perspectives fairly, note disagreements
- **Evidence-based** — Ground themes in specific source content
- **Clear** — Present complex ideas in accessible language

### 4. Output Format

Your synthesis should include:

```markdown
# Synthesis: [Topic]

## Overview

Brief summary of the synthesis scope and sources analyzed.

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: [Name]

Description of the theme and why it matters.

**Supporting evidence:**
- Source A: [finding or quote]
- Source B: [finding or quote]
- Source C: [finding or quote]

**Analysis:** How these findings relate and what they mean together.

### Theme 2: [Name]

[Same structure]

## Areas of Consensus

Where sources agree:
- Agreement 1: [description with source references]
- Agreement 2: [description with source references]

## Areas of Disagreement

Where sources contradict:
- Disagreement 1: [description of contradiction and sources]
- Disagreement 2: [description of contradiction and sources]

## Gaps and Questions

What the sources don't address:
- Gap 1: [description]
- Gap 2: [description]

## Implications

What the synthesized findings mean:
- Implication 1: [description]
- Implication 2: [description]

## Sources Referenced

List of all sources synthesized.
```

### 5. Verification

Before completing:

1. **Coverage check**: Did you integrate all key sources?
2. **Evidence check**: Is each theme grounded in specific source content?
3. **Balance check**: Are different perspectives represented fairly?
4. **Clarity check**: Can readers follow your synthesis?
5. **Acceptance criteria check**: Does output meet all requirements?

## Constraints

- Read all tracked sources before synthesizing
- Ground every theme in specific source evidence
- Note both agreements and contradictions
- Don't add ideas not present in sources
- Cite sources when referencing specific findings
- Focus on synthesis (integration), not just summary

## Instructions

1. **Read** all tracked source files completely
2. **Extract** key findings from each source
3. **Identify** themes and patterns across sources
4. **Draft** synthesis following the output format
5. **Verify** all themes are evidence-based and balanced
6. **Check off** each acceptance criterion in `{{spec.path}}` by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
7. **Commit** with message: `chant({{spec.id}}): <description>`
8. **Verify git status is clean** - ensure no uncommitted changes remain
