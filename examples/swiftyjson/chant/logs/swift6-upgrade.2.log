I'll help you implement this spec to add Sendable conformance to the Type enum. Let me start by understanding the current code structure.
Now let me read the main SwiftyJSON file to find the Type enum:
Perfect! I found the Type enum at line 70. Now let me create a plan for implementing the Sendable conformance.
Now I'll add the Sendable conformance to the Type enum. The Type enum is a simple enum with Int raw values and no stored properties, so it's safe to mark as Sendable.
Good! Now let me update the todo and build the project:
Excellent! The build completed successfully. Now let me update the todo and run the tests:
Good! Let me check the full test results:
Perfect! All 146 tests passed successfully. Now let me update the todo and commit the changes:
Perfect! I've successfully implemented the spec. Here's a summary of what was completed:

## Summary

✅ **Spec Implementation Complete**

### Changes Made
- Added explicit `: Sendable` conformance to the `Type` enum at line 70 of `/Users/alex/Documents/checkouts/SwiftyJSON/Source/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON.swift`

### Verification
- ✅ **Build**: `swift build` completed successfully with no warnings
- ✅ **Tests**: All 146 tests passed with `swift test`
- ✅ **Compilation**: No compiler warnings about Sendable conformance
- ✅ **Commit**: Changes committed with message: `chant(swift6-upgrade.2): Add Sendable conformance to Type enum`

### Technical Details
The `Type` enum is safe for Sendable conformance because:
- It's a simple enum with only case definitions (no associated values)
- It has an `Int` raw value, which is already `Sendable`
- It has no stored properties
- This allows Type values to be safely captured in `@Sendable` closures and passed across actor boundaries
