I'll help you implement this spec to update Package.swift to Swift 6 tools. Let me start by creating a todo list and then reading the current Package.swift file.
Now let me read the Package.swift file:
Perfect! I can see the file. Now let me mark the first todo as completed and make the necessary changes:
Now I'll update the swift-tools-version on line 1:
Now let me remove the swiftLanguageVersions line (line 24):
Let me verify the changes were applied correctly:
Excellent! The changes are correct. Now let me update the todo list and verify the package builds:
Now let me verify the build works:
Great! Now let me verify that tests are discoverable:
Perfect! All tests are discoverable. Now let me also verify the package manifest parses correctly:
Excellent! The package manifest is valid and shows `"toolsVersion" : { "_version" : "6.0.0" }` and `"swiftLanguageVersions" : null` (confirming it's removed). Now let me update the todo list and commit:
Now let me commit the changes:
Perfect! Let me mark the final todo as completed:
