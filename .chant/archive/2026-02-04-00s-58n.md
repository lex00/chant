# Make chant init set up merge driver by default

## Problem

Users must remember to pass `--merge-driver` to `chant init` or run `chant merge-driver-setup` separately. Without this, merging worktree branches causes spec status/AC conflicts.

## Solution

Change line 2199 in `src/main.rs` from conditional `if merge_driver { ... }` to always call `setup_merge_driver()`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove the `if merge_driver` condition at line 2199 in `src/main.rs` so `setup_merge_driver()` is called unconditionally
- [x] Run `cargo test test_init` and verify all init tests pass
- [x] Run `cargo build --release` to verify compilation succeeds

## Agent Output

2026-02-04T21:46:22Z

```
I'll implement the change to make `chant init` set up the merge driver by default.
## Summary

Changed `src/main.rs` to make merge driver setup run unconditionally during `chant init`.

- Removed `if merge_driver` conditional at line 2199
- Prefixed unused parameter with `_merge_driver`
- All init tests pass (10 tests)
- Release build succeeds```
