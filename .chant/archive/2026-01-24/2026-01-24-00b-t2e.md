# Add chant ready shortcut command

Add a `ready` command that's a shortcut for `chant list --ready`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `Ready` subcommand to CLI
- [x] Reuse the same logic as `list --ready`
- [x] Show ready specs (pending with all dependencies satisfied)

## Agent Output

```
The spec is complete. The `chant ready` command was already implemented:

- **`Ready` subcommand** is defined in the CLI enum at `src/main.rs:72-73`
- **Reuses `list --ready` logic** via `cmd_list(true, &[])` at `src/main.rs:95`
- **Shows ready specs** (pending specs with all dependencies satisfied)

I checked off all acceptance criteria and committed the changes.```
