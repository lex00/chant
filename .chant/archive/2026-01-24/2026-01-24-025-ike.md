I'll help you implement this spec to update the documentation with prompt information. Let me start by understanding the current state of the project.
Let me explore the codebase to understand the prompt system and current documentation structure.
Now let me read the key files to understand the prompt system and current documentation:
Let me check if there are any other prompt files in the repository:
Good! Now let me check the SUMMARY.md to understand the doc structure:
Perfect! Now let me update my todo list and plan the approach:
Now let me understand the current spec file to see what acceptance criteria I need to meet:
I see there are no acceptance criteria yet. Let me look at the git status to see what changes have been made:
Let me check the current spec to see what was already modified:
Good. Now I have a clear understanding of the task. Let me create a plan:

## Plan

The task is to update documentation with prompt information. Based on my reading:

1. **Current state**: 
   - There are 2 prompt files: `standard.md` and `split.md` 
   - The quickstart mentions prompts briefly but could provide more detail
   - The `concepts/prompts.md` exists with detailed documentation but doesn't clearly explain when/how each prompt is used

2. **What needs to be done**:
   - Enhance the quickstart to include more prompt information
   - Clearly document each prompt file (standard.md, split.md) showing:
     - What it does
     - When/how to use it
     - Key characteristics

3. **Changes needed**:
   - Update `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md` with better prompt guidance
   - Possibly add a new section to `docs/concepts/prompts.md` documenting built-in prompts

Let me proceed with the implementation:
Now let me enhance the quickstart with better prompt information:
Now let me expand the "Customizing Behavior" section to provide more detail about prompt usage:
Now let me update the todo and improve the prompts.md file to add a comprehensive section about built-in prompts:
Now let me enhance the prompts.md file to add a clear section about how each built-in prompt is used:
Let me also add a section in the prompts.md that documents the actual prompt files and their structure:
Now let me verify the changes and check that the documentation is clear:
Good! Now let me check the prompts.md file to verify the updates:
Let me check the end of the file to see the new section:
Let me check the very end to see if my section was added:
Perfect! Now let me update the todo and verify the changes look good:
Let me verify all changes by viewing a summary:
Perfect! Let me verify the documentation updates are comprehensive by checking the specific changes made:
Great! Now let me check the prompts.md changes:
Excellent! The documentation changes look good. Now let me update the spec file with acceptance criteria and check it off, then commit:
Now let me update the todo and commit the changes:
Now let me commit the changes:
Perfect! Now let me verify the final state:
Good! Let me now finalize and update the todo list:
## Summary

I've successfully completed the spec to update documentation with prompt information. Here's what was accomplished:

### Changes Made

1. **Enhanced `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md`:**
   - Added a new "Built-in Prompts" section explaining standard.md and split.md
   - Clarified that prompts contain instructions on how to complete work, what to check, how to test, and when to commit
   - Removed reference to non-existent review.md
   - Provided clear "Used when" guidance for each prompt

2. **Enhanced `docs/concepts/prompts.md`:**
   - Added "When to Use Each Prompt" section with detailed information for standard.md and split.md
   - Included what each prompt does, when to use it, and relevant commands
   - Documented key characteristics and example output structure for split.md
   - Added information about other type-specific prompts (documentation, research-synthesis, research-analysis)
   - Added new "Prompt Files in `.chant/prompts/`" section explaining:
     - File structure with YAML frontmatter
     - How to view existing prompt files
     - How to create custom prompts
