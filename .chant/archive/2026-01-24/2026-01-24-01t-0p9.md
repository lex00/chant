I'll help you implement this spec. Let me start by reading the spec file to understand the requirements.
Let me read the full spec file:
Let me search for the actual spec content by reading more:
The spec file appears minimal. Let me check the existing documentation to understand what needs to be changed:
Now let me search for the current tagline "Intent driven development" in the documentation:
Good! Found it in README.md. Let me check that file and also look for similar phrases:
Perfect! I can see the current tagline is "Intent driven development" on line 5 of README.md. Now let me search for all occurrences of "intent driven" across the codebase:
Now let me look at the spec file structure to understand what acceptance criteria I need to verify. Let me check if there's a template or other similar specs:
The spec file is quite minimal. Let me check another completed spec to understand the expected format:
I see the pattern. Let me now plan the implementation. Based on my findings, I need to:

1. Change "Intent driven development" to "Idempotent Intention" in README.md
2. Search for any other relevant phrases that need updating
3. Add acceptance criteria to the spec
4. Implement the changes
5. Verify and commit

Let me use the TodoWrite tool to track this:
Now let me update the README.md file:
Great! Now let me mark that todo as completed and move on to building/testing:
Now let me build the project to verify no issues:
Excellent! Build succeeded. Let me mark that done and verify the README change:
Perfect! Now let me update the spec file with acceptance criteria and mark the tasks as complete:
Now let me edit the spec file to add acceptance criteria and mark the update as completed:
Now let me update the spec file to mark it as completed and add the model tag:
Perfect! Now let me update the todos and create the commit:
Now let me create the commit:
Excellent! Let me verify the final state:
Perfect! Let me mark the final task as completed:
Perfect! Let me verify the spec file one more time to make sure everything is correct:
