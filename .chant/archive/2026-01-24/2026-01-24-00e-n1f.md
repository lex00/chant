# Add GitHub Actions CI for build and tests

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Rust project and runs tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [x] Trigger on push to main and pull requests
- [x] Run on ubuntu-latest
- [x] Install Rust toolchain
- [x] Run `cargo build`
- [x] Run `cargo test`
- [x] Run `cargo clippy` for linting
- [x] Run `cargo fmt --check` for formatting

## Implementation Notes

- Use `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` action
- Cache cargo dependencies for faster builds
- Run clippy with `-D warnings` to fail on warnings

## Agent Output

2026-01-24T12:29:23Z

```
The spec has been completed. The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file was already in place with all the required functionality:

- Triggers on push to main and pull requests
- Runs on ubuntu-latest
- Uses `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` with clippy and rustfmt components
- Caches cargo dependencies with `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`
- Runs `cargo fmt --check` for formatting
- Runs `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` for linting
- Runs `cargo build`
- Runs `cargo test`

I checked off all acceptance criteria and committed the changes with `chant(2026-01-24-00e-n1f): Check off acceptance criteria for CI workflow`.```
