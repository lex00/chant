# Create Cursor Quick Start guide for new users

Create a human-readable quick start guide for users new to both Cursor and chant. This complements the `.cursorrules` file (which is for Cursor's AI).

## Target Audience

Someone who:
- Has Cursor installed (or needs to install it)
- Wants to use chant for spec-driven development
- Is new to both tools

## Sections to Include

1. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
2. **Install chant** - How to install the CLI
3. **Initialize your project** - `chant init --agent cursor`
4. **Verify MCP is working** - How to confirm Cursor sees the chant tools
5. **Your first spec** - Create, work, and complete a simple spec
6. **Workflow overview** - Quick reference for daily use

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `docs/guides/cursor-quickstart.md`
- [x] Document chant installation (cargo install, homebrew, or binary)
- [x] Document `chant init --agent cursor` and what it creates
- [x] Explain how to verify MCP is configured (restart Cursor, check tools available)
- [x] Walk through creating and working a first spec
- [x] Include troubleshooting section (MCP not loading, common errors)
- [x] Link to `.cursorrules` as the technical reference for Cursor's AI behavior

## Agent Output

I'll create a comprehensive Cursor Quick Start guide for new users. Let me start by reading the existing `.cursorrules` file and related documentation to understand what's already covered.
Let me check what files exist in the project:
I can see there's already a cursor-quickstart.md file. Let me read it to see what's already there:
Perfect! I can see there's already a comprehensive Cursor Quick Start guide. Now let me check the spec to see what changes might be needed:
Great! The file already exists and appears to be comprehensive. Let me verify it meets all the acceptance criteria:
Let me check each acceptance criterion against the existing file:

1. ✅ **Create `docs/guides/cursor-quickstart.md`** - File exists at the correct location
2. ✅ **Document chant installation** - Lines 19-60 cover Homebrew, quick install scripts, and cargo
3. ✅ **Document `chant init --agent cursor`** - Lines 62-75 explain the command and what it creates
4. ✅ **Explain how to verify MCP is configured** - Lines 77-99 cover restarting Cursor and verifying MCP tools
5. ✅ **Walk through creating and working a first spec** - Lines 101-153 provide a complete walkthrough
6. ✅ **Include troubleshooting section** - Lines 294-340 have comprehensive troubleshooting
7. ✅ **Link to `.cursorrules`** - Lines 199-209 explain the `.cursorrules` file and line 292 links to it as a reference

The existing file is excellent and meets all the acceptance criteria. Let me update the spec to mark all criteria as complete:
Now I'll update the spec to mark all acceptance criteria as complete:
Now let me commit the changes:
Perfect! The Cursor Quick Start guide documentation is complete. The file `docs/guides/cursor-quickstart.md` already existed and comprehensively covers all the required acceptance criteria:

## Summary

✅ **All acceptance criteria met:**

1. **File created** at `docs/guides/cursor-quickstart.md`
2. **Installation documented** - Covers Homebrew, quick install scripts for Linux/macOS, and cargo
3. **Init command explained** - Details `chant init --agent cursor` and the files it creates (.cursorrules, .cursor/mcp.json, .chant/ directory)
4. **MCP verification** - Step-by-step guide for restarting Cursor and confirming MCP tools are loaded
5. **First spec walkthrough** - Complete example from `chant add` through `chant work` to reviewing changes
6. **Troubleshooting** - Comprehensive section covering MCP not loading, initialization errors, agent failures, and common mistakes
7. **Links to .cursorrules** - Referenced as the technical reference for Cursor's AI behavior

The guide is well-structured for new users with clear prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, daily workflow examples, and helpful troubleshooting tips. All acceptance criteria checkboxes have been marked complete and the work has been committed with the proper `chant(2026-01-30-00c-wva)` message format.```
