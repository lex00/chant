# Write lifecycle example guide

Create a single-document walkthrough that demonstrates the complete spec lifecycle using a feature-build scenario. A developer adds an export command to an existing CLI tool and encounters every lifecycle phase naturally.

## Scenario outline

1. **Create** — `chant add`, auto-lint shows feedback, refine until quality improves
2. **Split** — complexity too high, `chant split` creates driver + members
3. **Dependencies** — members depend on each other, `chant ready` shows ordering
4. **Execute** — `chant work --chain`, watch auto-starts, worktree isolation
5. **Failure** — tests fail on one member (edge case)
6. **Recover** — `chant reset`, retry with attempt tracking
7. **Complete** — all members done, driver auto-completes, worktrees cleaned up
8. **Verify** — `chant verify` confirms acceptance criteria
9. **Drift** — weeks later, upstream data model changes, watch detects drift, auto-runs verify, marks needs_attention
10. **React** — developer creates follow-up spec

## Guidelines

- Show actual `chant` commands and realistic output at each phase
- Brief "under the hood" notes explaining what chant does (state machine transitions, worktree creation, etc.)
- Keep it practical — this is a tutorial, not architecture docs
- Reference existing docs for deeper dives (link to concepts/lifecycle.md, patterns.md, etc.)

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Guide covers all 10 lifecycle phases listed above
- [ ] Each phase shows the command, example output, and brief explanation
- [ ] Guide is a single cohesive narrative, not disconnected sections
- [ ] No references to unimplemented features (hooks, webhooks, tantivy, log rotation)
- [ ] All commands shown actually exist in the current CLI

## Agent Output

```
I'll create a comprehensive lifecycle walkthrough guide that demonstrates chant's complete workflow through a realistic feature-build scenario.
## Summary

Created `docs/guides/lifecycle-walkthrough.md` demonstrating chant's complete spec lifecycle through a feature-build scenario.

The guide follows a developer adding an export command to a CLI tool, naturally encountering all 10 lifecycle phases:
- Create with auto-lint feedback and refinement
- Split when complexity thresholds exceeded
- Dependencies showing execution ordering
- Execute with chain mode and worktree isolation
- Failure from edge case in tests
- Recover with reset and retry tracking
- Complete with auto-finalization and cleanup
- Verify acceptance criteria before deploy
- Drift detected weeks later via scheduled verification
- React by creating follow-up spec

Each phase shows actual commands, realistic output, and brief explanations of what chant does internally (state transitions, worktree management, watch coordination).```
