# Update operations and MCP docs to match source

Two doc-vs-source mismatches found during audit.

## Changes

### operations-layer.md
The "Current Operations" table lists only 4 modules (create, finalize, reset, update). The actual operations layer has 10 modules: archive, cancel, commits, create, finalize, model, pause, reset, update, verify. Update the table to list all 10.

### mcp.md
Tool count says "23 tools" but code has 24 (chant_split was added). Update the count and add chant_split to the mutating tools list.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] operations-layer.md lists all 10 operation modules with descriptions
- [x] mcp.md tool count updated to 24
- [x] chant_split listed in mutating tools section of mcp.md
- [x] No other doc-vs-source mismatches in these two files

## Agent Output

2026-02-08T11:36:17Z

```
I'll update the documentation to match the actual source code.
## Summary

Updated operations-layer.md and mcp.md to match actual source code.

- Added table listing all 10 operation modules (archive, cancel, commits, create, finalize, model, pause, reset, update, verify)
- Updated MCP tool count from 23 to 24
- Added chant_split to mutating tools table with proper description```
