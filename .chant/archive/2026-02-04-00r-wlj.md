# Add test fixtures for sample specs

## Problem

Tests create spec content inline. Need reusable fixture files.

## Solution

Create `tests/fixtures/` with sample spec files and loader function.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `tests/fixtures/simple_spec.md` with minimal valid spec (type: code, status: pending, simple title)
- [x] Create `tests/support/fixtures.rs` with `load_fixture(name: &str) -> String` function
- [x] Add `pub mod fixtures;` to `tests/support/mod.rs`
- [x] `load_fixture("simple_spec")` returns contents of `tests/fixtures/simple_spec.md`
- [x] Run `cargo build --tests` and confirm zero errors

## Agent Output
