# Fix Kiro rules.md template - remove chant-dev justfile references

The `templates/agent-kiro.md` file is embedded into the chant binary and deposited as `.kiro/rules.md` in customer projects during `chant init --agent kiro`. The template currently contains references to chant's own development justfile (`just build`, `just test`, `just lint`, `just chant show <spec-id>`, etc.) and Rust-specific tooling ("Never run cargo commands directly") that are nonsensical for customer projects.

The template needs to be rewritten to provide generic, project-agnostic instructions for working with chant specs, without assuming any particular build system or language.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove all `just` command references and replace with generic build tool guidance
- [x] Remove Rust-specific tooling references ("Never run cargo commands directly")
- [x] Provide examples for multiple languages/ecosystems (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust)
- [x] Update commands table to only show core chant commands (not `just chant` wrapper)
- [x] Ensure template is project-agnostic and suitable for any language/framework

## Agent Output

```
I'll fix the Kiro template to remove chant-dev specific references.
## Summary

Rewrote `templates/agent-kiro.md` to be project-agnostic.

- Replaced all `just` command references with generic build tool guidance
- Removed Rust-specific tooling constraints ("Never run cargo commands directly")
- Added multi-language examples (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust) for tests/linting/formatting
- Updated commands table to show only core `chant` CLI commands (removed `just chant` wrapper references)
- Simplified workflow steps to work for any project type

Template is now suitable for customer projects in any language or framework.```
