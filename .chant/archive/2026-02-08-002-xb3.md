# Review OSS maintainer workflow for accuracy

Check all commands, config examples, and feature references in the OSS maintainer workflow docs against the current implementation. Fix stale references from recent pruning. Do not add new features.

## Checks to perform

- All `chant` commands shown exist and have correct flags
- Config examples use valid fields (no removed features)
- No references to hooks, webhooks, tantivy, log rotation, or autonomy decision levels
- Spec frontmatter examples use valid field names
- Workflow narrative is internally consistent

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Every `chant` command in the workflow docs is valid against current CLI
- [x] No stale feature references remain
- [x] Config/frontmatter examples use only implemented fields

## Agent Output

I'll review the OSS maintainer workflow documentation for accuracy against the current implementation.
Now I need to check for any stale feature references mentioned in the spec. Let me search for references to hooks, webhooks, tantivy, log rotation, or autonomy decision levels in the workflow docs.
Now let me check the command usage in the docs more carefully, particularly checking if `--type` is a valid flag and verifying frontmatter examples:
Now let me check the frontmatter examples in the docs to see what fields are used:
Based on my review, I found several issues:

1. **`--type` flag does not exist** - The `chant add` command does not have a `--type` flag. Specs are created and then their type is set in the frontmatter.

2. **`chant resume` is deprecated** - The docs reference `chant resume` but it's deprecated in favor of `chant reset`.

3. **Prompt names may be incorrect** - Some examples use `prompt: reproduce` and `prompt: research` which may not be actual prompts.

Let me verify the actual prompts that exist:
Good - the prompts `reproduce` and `research` do exist. Now let me create fixes for the documentation issues I found:
Now let me check the spec file and mark the acceptance criteria as completed:
## Summary

Fixed stale command references in OSS maintainer workflow docs.

**Key changes:**
- Removed nonexistent `--type` flag from all `chant add` commands (17 instances across 7 files)
- Updated deprecated `chant resume` to `chant reset --work` (2 instances)
- All examples now correctly show setting type in frontmatter after creating spec

**Findings:**
- No references to removed features (hooks, webhooks, tantivy, log rotation, autonomy levels)
- All frontmatter field names are valid (type, status, prompt, depends_on, informed_by, target_files, labels)
- All commands validated against current CLI help output```
