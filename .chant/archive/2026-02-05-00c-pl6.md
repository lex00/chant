# chant merge --delete-branch should also remove worktrees before deleting branches. Currently only deletes the git branch but leaves worktree directories in /tmp. Should call `git worktree remove <path>` before `git branch -d`. Also consider: in monorepos with multiple chant projects, worktrees are shared at repo level - merge should handle worktrees matching the spec's branch pattern regardless of which chant project created them.
