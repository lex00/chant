# Fix skill install on agent-only update path + add tests

`chant init --agent kiro` on an existing project (where `.chant/` already exists) hits `handle_agent_update()` which doesn't write skills. The skill writing code was only added to the fresh init path. Also need integration tests to verify skill files are created for all providers in both code paths.
