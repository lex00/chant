# Evaluate recovery.md and ecosystem.md guides for expansion or removal

## Goal

Determine whether recovery.md and ecosystem.md should become full multi-file guides with examples, or be removed/consolidated.

## Research Questions

- [x] What does recovery.md currently cover? Is it substantial enough for an example?
- [x] What does ecosystem.md currently cover? Is it substantial enough for an example?
- [x] Are these guides referenced elsewhere in the documentation?
- [x] Would users benefit from working examples of these workflows?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Document findings in `.chant/research/guide-evaluation.md`
- [x] Provide recommendation: expand, consolidate, or remove each guide
- [x] If recommending removal, identify what content should be preserved elsewhere

## Agent Output

```
I'll investigate the recovery.md and ecosystem.md guides to evaluate whether they should be expanded or removed.
## Summary

Completed evaluation of recovery.md and ecosystem.md guides.

**Findings:**
- **recovery.md**: Keep as single-file reference guide. Comprehensive (178 lines), actively maintained, referenced by 4 source files, optimal for emergency recovery scenarios. No expansion needed.
- **ecosystem.md**: Remove or consolidate. 90% describes unimplemented features (prompt registry planned for v0.4.0+), only provider adapters exist, creates user confusion. Move minimal provider config to reference documentation.

**Research documented in:** `.chant/research/guide-evaluation.md````
