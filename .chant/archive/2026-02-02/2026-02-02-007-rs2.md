# Standardize TDD workflow guide to use informed_by consistently

## Output

## Audit Findings

The TDD workflow uses `context:` field where the research-workflow guide uses `informed_by:`. This creates inconsistency.

**Current (03-test-planning.md line 101-102):**
```yaml
context:
  - .chant/context/tdd-standards/coverage-requirements.md
```

**Should be:**
```yaml
informed_by:
  - .chant/context/tdd-standards/coverage-requirements.md
```

## Files to Update

- `docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/03-test-planning.md`
- `docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/04-execution.md` (if applicable)
- Any other files using `context:` in spec examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `03-test-planning.md` uses `informed_by:` instead of `context:` for research spec example
- [x] All spec examples in TDD guide consistently use `informed_by:` for input sources
- [x] Chain from research `target_files:` → code spec `informed_by:` is demonstrated

```
I'll standardize the TDD workflow guide to use `informed_by` consistently.
## Summary

Changed 2 files to standardize field naming in TDD workflow guide.

- Updated `03-test-planning.md`: changed `context:` to `informed_by:` in research spec example
- Updated `artifacts/coverage-research-spec-001-cov.md`: changed `context:` to `informed_by:` in completed spec example

All acceptance criteria met. Git status clean.```
