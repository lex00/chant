# Document testing workflow

Update `examples/README.md` with comprehensive testing instructions.

### Inherited Context

- Testing workflow should be simple and clear

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add "Testing" section to examples/README.md
- [x] Document how to run all examples: `./test-examples.sh all`
- [x] Document how to run single example: `./test-examples.sh <name>`
- [x] Explain validation: Each example has test-assertions.sh for output verification
- [x] Include example output showing what successful test run looks like

## Agent Output
