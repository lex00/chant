# Create validation scripts for each example

Add `test-assertions.sh` to each example for output validation.

### Inherited Context

- Validation must verify semantic correctness, not just file existence
- Scripts should be runnable independently after example execution

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Each of 5 examples has `test-assertions.sh` script
- [x] Scripts check required output files exist
- [x] Scripts validate key content in output files (semantic checks)
- [x] Scripts exit 0 on pass, 1 on failure with descriptive error message
- [x] Scripts are executable (chmod +x)

### Edge Cases

- Partial execution: Script should report which assertions passed/failed
- File content variations: Use flexible pattern matching (grep/regex) not exact string matches
- Missing output directory: Script should fail gracefully with clear message

### Example Test Cases

For each example, verify:
- approval-workflow: Check pull request markdown file exists and contains approval criteria
- kpi-okr-workflow: Verify OKR tracking document has quarterly targets
- tdd-workflow: Confirm test file exists and includes assertion patterns
- research-workflow: Validate summary markdown contains findings and sources
- oss-maintainer-workflow: Check release notes and issue triage files exist

## Agent Output

```
I'll implement validation scripts for each example. Let me start by examining the existing examples structure.
## Summary

Created `test-assertions.sh` scripts for all 5 examples with semantic validation checking:

- **approval-workflow**: Validates approval frontmatter structure (required, approved, rejected states)
- **kpi-okr-workflow**: Checks driver/member specs, context files, and churn impact metrics
- **tdd-workflow**: Validates coverage analysis, driver pattern, and test case counts
- **research-workflow**: Separate scripts for academic-path (papers) and developer-path (code analysis)
- **oss-maintainer-workflow**: Validates 6-phase sequential chain with research specs and dependencies

All scripts use flexible pattern matching, report pass/fail counts, and exit with proper codes.```
