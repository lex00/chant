# Create TDD workflow example in examples folder

## Output

## Goal

Create a standalone working example demonstrating the TDD workflow from `docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/`.

## Example Structure

```
examples/tdd-workflow/
├── README.md
├── .chant/
│   ├── config.md
│   ├── context/
│   │   └── tdd-standards/
│   │       ├── coverage-requirements.md    # Team test standards
│   │       └── test-patterns.md            # Naming conventions
│   ├── specs/
│   │   ├── 001-coverage-analysis.md        # Research: analyze gaps
│   │   ├── 002-test-suite-driver.md        # Driver: coordinate tests

├── src/
│   └── payments/
│       └── refund.py                       # Sample code to test
└── tests/
    └── payments/
        └── test_refund_flow.py             # Generated test file
```

## What to Demonstrate

1. **Context standards** - Test naming conventions, coverage requirements
2. **Research spec** - Coverage gap analysis with `informed_by:` and `target_files:`
3. **Test planning** - Acceptance criteria as test cases
4. **Driver + members** - Parallel test implementation

## Based On

Extract realistic content from:
- `docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/03-test-planning.md`
- `docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/artifacts/`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `examples/tdd-workflow/README.md` explains TDD workflow phases
- [x] `.chant/context/tdd-standards/` contains test standards files
- [x] Coverage analysis spec uses `informed_by:` and produces `target_files:`
- [x] Driver spec with 3 member specs showing test categories
- [x] Sample `src/payments/refund.py` with code to test
- [x] Sample `tests/payments/test_refund_flow.py` showing test structure
- [x] `examples/README.md` updated to list the new example

## Agent Output

2026-02-02T13:04:21Z

```
I'll implement the TDD workflow example in the examples folder.
## Summary

Created complete TDD workflow example in `examples/tdd-workflow/`.

- 13 files: specs, config, test standards, sample code, and test file
- README.md explains 3 TDD workflow phases (research, planning, implementation)
- Context standards: coverage-requirements.md and test-patterns.md
- Research spec (001) shows `informed_by:` and `target_files:` usage
- Driver spec (002) coordinates 3 member specs for parallel test execution
- Sample refund.py service and test_refund_flow.py with 16 test cases
- Updated examples/README.md to list new TDD workflow example

All acceptance criteria met. Tests passing. Committed as 9330784.```
