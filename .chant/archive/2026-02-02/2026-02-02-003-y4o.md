# Add chant dag command - visualize spec dependency graph

## Agent Output

2026-02-02T21:18:57Z

```
I'll implement the `chant dag` command to visualize spec dependency graphs.
## Summary

Added `chant dag` command to visualize spec dependency graphs.

- Created `src/cmd/spec/dag.rs` with graph visualization logic
- Added command definition to `src/main.rs` with detail/status/label/type filters
- Integrated with existing graph rendering module from `site::graph`
- Supports three detail levels: minimal (IDs only), titles (IDs + titles), full (IDs + titles + status + labels)```
