# Add missing prompts to example .chant/prompts directories

## Problem

Example specs reference prompts that don't exist in their example directories:
- oss-maintainer-workflow: needs `research` prompt
- research-workflow/academic-path: needs `research-synthesis` prompt
- research-workflow/developer-path: needs `research-analysis` prompt

## Solution

Copy the relevant prompts from the main chant `.chant/prompts/` directory to each example's prompts directory.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/.chant/prompts/research.md` exists
- [x] `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/prompts/research-synthesis.md` exists
- [x] `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/prompts/research-analysis.md` exists
- [x] Prompts contain valid prompt content (not empty)

## Agent Output

```
I'll implement the spec to add missing prompts to example directories.
## Summary

Copied missing prompts from `.chant/prompts/` to example directories:

- `research.md` → `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/.chant/prompts/`
- `research-synthesis.md` → `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/prompts/`
- `research-analysis.md` → `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/prompts/`

All acceptance criteria met. Changes committed.```
