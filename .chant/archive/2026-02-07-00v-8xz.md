# Add architecture patterns documentation

## Context

Chant's 18K LOC codebase implements ~20 well-known software patterns across its layers. There's no documentation mapping the code to these patterns — making it hard for contributors to navigate.

## Content to Document

Create `docs/architecture/patterns.md` with ASCII diagrams mapping chant's architecture to software patterns. Cover:

1. **State Machine** (TransitionBuilder) — composable preconditions via Builder pattern
2. **Execution Engine** (executor.rs) — Template Method + Strategy across single/chain/parallel
3. **Worktree Isolation** — Sandbox pattern with Mutex for serialized creation
4. **Dependency Graph** — DAG with topological sort and cycle detection
5. **Merge Driver** — Declarative Rules Engine (field → strategy table)
6. **MCP Interface** — Command pattern with self-describing tool registry
7. **Provider Abstraction** — Strategy pattern for pluggable AI backends
8. **Spec Groups** — Composite pattern (driver/member hierarchy)
9. **Watch Service** — Observer via polling with crash recovery
10. **Operations Layer** — Facade/Service Layer shared by CLI and MCP
11. **Config** — Layered Configuration merge (global → project → agent)
12. **Output** — Strategy + Adapter for Human/JSON/Quiet modes
13. **Score/Lint** — Composite scorer aggregating independent metrics

For each pattern: name it, show where in the code it lives (file paths), and include an ASCII diagram showing the structure or flow.

## Task

1. Create `docs/architecture/patterns.md` with the content above
2. Add it to `docs/SUMMARY.md` under the Architecture section (after "Agent Protocol")

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `docs/architecture/patterns.md` exists with all 13 patterns documented
- [x] Each pattern has: name, code location, ASCII diagram, brief explanation
- [x] Added to SUMMARY.md under Architecture section
- [x] `mdbook build docs/` succeeds (if mdbook is available, otherwise verify markdown is valid)

## Agent Output

```
I'll implement this spec by creating the architecture patterns documentation. Let me start by reading the relevant files to understand the project structure and existing documentation.
Now I'll create the architecture patterns documentation file:
## Summary

Created `docs/architecture/patterns.md` documenting 13 architectural patterns in chant's codebase with ASCII diagrams:

- State Machine (TransitionBuilder) - composable preconditions
- Execution Engine - Template Method + Strategy
- Worktree Isolation - Sandbox + Mutex
- Dependency Graph - DAG with cycle detection
- Merge Driver - Rules Engine
- MCP Interface - Command pattern
- Provider Abstraction - Strategy pattern
- Spec Groups - Composite pattern
- Watch Service - Observer pattern
- Operations Layer - Facade/Service Layer
- Config - Layered Configuration merge
- Output - Strategy + Adapter
- Score/Lint - Composite scorer

Added entry to `docs/SUMMARY.md` under Architecture section. Verified markdown builds successfully with mdbook. Committed changes to git.```
