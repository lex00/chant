# Add Hypothesis Elimination as explicit deliverable in Root Cause

## Context

User feedback: "Between Comprehension and Root Cause there's an implicit phase where you test and discard theories. Each elimination narrowed the search. The workflow doesn't acknowledge this as a distinct activity. It matters because it's where most of the time goes, and it produces valuable negative results that should be documented."

## Task

Update `03-root-cause.md` to add Hypothesis Elimination as an explicit sub-activity with its own deliverable format. Add a "Ruled-Out Hypotheses" table template showing hypothesis, evidence tested, and result. Acknowledge that this elimination loop is where most investigation time is spent and that negative results are valuable documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `03-root-cause.md` has a new "Hypothesis Elimination" section
- [x] Section includes a table template: Hypothesis | Evidence Tested | Result (confirmed/eliminated/partial)
- [x] Docs acknowledge this is where most investigation time goes
- [x] Research output template updated to include ruled-out hypotheses as a deliverable
- [x] Existing example RCA output structure in the doc is updated to show the hypothesis table
