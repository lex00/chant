# Add examples/test-examples.sh to CI workflow as primary integration validation

## Context

`examples/test-examples.sh` tests real user workflows end-to-end but isn't run in CI. These are more valuable than unit tests for catching real bugs.

## Tasks

1. Add new CI job that runs `examples/test-examples.sh`
2. Job should run after build succeeds
3. Run on ubuntu-latest only (examples use bash)
4. Cache cargo build to speed up example runs

## Implementation

Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
  examples:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
      - name: Build chant
        run: cargo build --release
      - name: Run example workflows
        run: |
          export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
          ./examples/test-examples.sh all
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] New `examples` job added to CI workflow
- [x] Job runs after build job completes
- [x] `examples/test-examples.sh all` executes successfully
- [x] CI passes with new job

## Agent Output

2026-02-03T22:35:52Z

```
I'll implement the CI workflow changes to add example testing.
## Summary

Added new `examples` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs end-to-end integration tests.

- New job depends on `build` and runs on ubuntu-latest
- Uses cargo cache and builds release binary before running tests
- Executes `examples/test-examples.sh all` to validate real workflows

All acceptance criteria met and committed.```
