# Docs: Clean up OSS guide file naming - remove duplicate files

## Problem
OSS maintainer workflow guide has duplicate/conflicting files:
- `01-triage.md` AND `01-comprehension.md` (both have "01-" prefix)
- `03-root-cause.md` AND `03-research.md` (both have "03-" prefix)
- Stub files with only headers: `04-implementation.md`, `05-review.md`, `06-documentation.md`, `07-release.md`

## Solution
1. Delete `01-triage.md` (stub, `01-comprehension.md` is the real content)
2. Consolidate `03-root-cause.md` and `03-research.md` into one file
3. Delete empty stub files OR populate with real content from example source
4. Update `index.md` to remove dead links
5. Delete `09-example.md` (redundant - guide IS the walkthrough)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Remove duplicate 01-* files (keep comprehension)
- [x] Consolidate 03-* files into single file
- [x] Remove or populate stub files (04, 05, 06, 07)
- [x] Delete 09-example.md
- [x] Update index.md navigation
- [x] Verify no broken links in guide

I'll implement the documentation cleanup task for the OSS guide.
## Summary
