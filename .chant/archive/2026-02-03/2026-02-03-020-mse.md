# Fix Docker build: Add missing templates/, prompts/, prompts-dev/ directories to Dockerfile COPY commands

## Agent Output

2026-02-03T15:52:00Z

```
I'll read the spec file first to understand the requirements.
The spec file appears to be minimal. Let me check if there's more content or if there's a body file.
The spec indicates I need to fix a Docker build issue by adding missing directory COPY commands. Let me read the Dockerfile to understand the current state.
I can see the Dockerfile currently only copies `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and the `src` directory. Let me check if the directories `templates/`, `prompts/`, and `prompts-dev/` actually exist in the project.
Good, all three directories exist. Now let me check what's inside them to confirm they're needed at runtime.
These directories contain template and prompt files that are likely needed at runtime. Let me update the Dockerfile to include them in the build stage COPY commands.
## Summary

Added COPY commands to Dockerfile for three required directories:

- templates/ - contains agent and site template files
- prompts/ - contains prompt definition files for various operations
- prompts-dev/ - contains development prompts

These directories are needed at runtime and were missing from the Docker build, which would cause failures when the containerized application tried to access them.
