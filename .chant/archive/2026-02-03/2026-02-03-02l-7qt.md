# Ensure test coverage for config loading and merging (global + project config)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Unit tests verify config merging behavior (already exist in src/config/tests.rs)
- [x] Integration tests verify global + project config loading end-to-end
- [x] Tests verify project config overrides global config values
- [x] Tests verify global config is used when project config doesn't specify values
- [x] Tests verify config loading works without global config

## Agent Output

```
I'll implement test coverage for config loading and merging. Let me start by reading the spec and relevant code.
Good existing test coverage. Need to add tests specifically for global+project config merging as integration tests. Let me check what's missing and add comprehensive tests.
## Summary

Added comprehensive integration tests for config loading and merging in tests/integration/config_test.rs.

- test_config_loading_global_and_project_merge: Verifies global config values are used when project doesn't specify them, and project values override global
- test_config_loading_project_overrides_all_global_fields: Confirms project config completely overrides all global settings when specified
- test_config_loading_no_global_uses_project_only: Validates config loading works correctly without a global config file

All tests pass alongside existing unit tests in src/config/tests.rs that already covered the merge logic at the unit level.```
