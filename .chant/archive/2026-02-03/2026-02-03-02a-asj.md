# Fix CI: make tarpaulin coverage non-fatal

## Problem

Tarpaulin reports "Test failed during run" and exits with code 1 even when all 253 tests pass. This is a known tarpaulin bug. The `--skip-clean` flag didn't fix it.

## Solution

In `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, add `continue-on-error: true` to the coverage generation step:

```yaml
- name: Generate coverage
  continue-on-error: true
  run: cargo tarpaulin --out xml --skip-clean
```

This allows CI to pass while still generating coverage data for Codecov.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] CI workflow passes (green badge)

## Agent Output

2026-02-03T17:01:11Z

```
I'll fix the CI workflow to make tarpaulin coverage non-fatal.
## Summary

Added `continue-on-error: true` to the tarpaulin coverage step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml:78`.

- CI will now pass even when tarpaulin exits with code 1
- Coverage data will still be generated and uploaded to Codecov
- All acceptance criteria met```
