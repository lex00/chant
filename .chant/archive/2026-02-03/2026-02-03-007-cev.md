# Docs: Consolidate prompt documentation (concepts + guides) with cross-references

The two prompt documentation files have overlapping content and need better cross-referencing to avoid duplication and confusion.

## Changes Made

1. **Added cross-reference at top of guide** - Points readers to concepts doc for basic usage and reference tables
2. **Consolidated template variables** - Guide now references concepts doc instead of duplicating the table
3. **Updated built-in prompts** - Fixed inaccuracies and aligned both docs with actual prompts in the codebase:
   - Updated concepts table to list: bootstrap, standard, split, document, research, merge-conflict
   - Added bootstrap example to guide (it's the default)
   - Removed minimal example from guide (doesn't exist)
   - Added cross-reference in guide's built-in prompts section
4. **Enhanced concepts doc** - Added reference to guide's built-in prompts section for detailed examples

## Result

- Concepts doc: Quick reference with tables and basic usage
- Guide: Deep dive with examples, patterns, and best practices
- Both documents now clearly reference each other
- No duplicate content (template variables table only in concepts)
- Accurate list of built-in prompts matching the codebase

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Cross-reference added at top of guides/prompts.md pointing to concepts/prompts.md
- [x] Template variables section in guide references concepts doc instead of duplicating table
- [x] Built-in prompts table in concepts/prompts.md matches actual prompts in codebase
- [x] Bootstrap prompt example added to guide (it's the default)
- [x] Minimal prompt example removed from guide (doesn't exist in codebase)
- [x] Cross-reference in guide's built-in prompts section points to concepts
- [x] Cross-reference in concepts doc's built-in prompts section points to guide
- [x] Both files remain coherent and useful on their own while complementing each other
