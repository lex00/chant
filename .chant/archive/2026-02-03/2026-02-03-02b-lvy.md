# Fix CI: codecov upload fails when tarpaulin doesn't generate coverage file

## Problem

When tarpaulin fails (even with continue-on-error), it doesn't generate `cobertura.xml`. Codecov then fails because `fail_ci_if_error: true`.

## Solution

In `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, change the codecov step:

```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
    files: ./cobertura.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: false
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] In `.github/workflows/ci.yml:85`, change `fail_ci_if_error: true` to `fail_ci_if_error: false`

## Agent Output

2026-02-03T17:07:50Z

```
I'll implement this CI fix by modifying the codecov step configuration.
## Summary

Changed `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to prevent CI failure when tarpaulin doesn't generate coverage file.

- Modified `fail_ci_if_error` from `true` to `false` in codecov upload step (line 86)
- Allows CI to continue even when coverage file is missing
- Committed changes with spec ID 2026-02-03-02b-lvy```
