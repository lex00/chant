# Feature: chant init generates CLAUDE.md with orchestrator instructions - skip if exists, support global location next to binary

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `chant init --agent claude` creates CLAUDE.md in project root
- [x] CLAUDE.md contains chant orchestrator instructions (using inject_chant_section)
- [x] Skip project CLAUDE.md if already exists (preserve user content)
- [x] Create global CLAUDE.md next to chant binary (e.g., ~/.cargo/bin/CLAUDE.md)
- [x] Skip global CLAUDE.md if already up-to-date
- [x] Append/update global CLAUDE.md if exists with different content
- [x] Use appropriate template (MCP version if MCP is configured)
- [x] All existing tests pass
