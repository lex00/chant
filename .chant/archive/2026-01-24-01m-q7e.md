# Author CLAUDE.md file with chant workflow constraints

Create the project's CLAUDE.md file documenting how AI agents should work with this codebase.

## Key Constraints to Document

1. **Always use `just chant` for the chant CLI binary** - not `./target/debug/chant` or `cargo run`

2. **Never touch the disk directly** - only the chant CLI gets to write files during spec work

3. **Always use a spec for even the smallest operations** - no ad-hoc changes

## CLAUDE.md Content Should Include

### Project Overview
- Chant is an Intent Driven Development tool
- Specs define work, agents execute specs

### Workflow Rules
- Use `just chant add "description"` to create specs
- Use `just chant work <spec-id>` to execute specs
- Use `just chant list` to see available specs
- Use `just chant show <spec-id>` to view spec details

### Development Commands
- `just chant` - the primary CLI entry point
- Build: `cargo build`
- Test: `cargo test`
- Lint: `cargo clippy`

### File Structure
- `.chant/specs/` - spec files
- `src/main.rs` - main entry point
- `src/spec.rs` - spec parsing/handling

### Important Patterns
- Spec IDs follow format: `YYYY-MM-DD-XXX-abc`
- Split specs use `.N` suffix (e.g., `01e-o0l.1`)
- Driver specs have `type: group`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CLAUDE.md exists in project root
- [x] Documents the three key constraints above
- [x] Includes common chant commands
- [x] Describes project structure
- [x] Explains spec workflow

## Agent Output

I'll help you create the CLAUDE.md file for the chant project. Let me start by reading the relevant code to understand the project structure and workflow.
Let me read the spec file to understand the current state and check the main.rs file in sections:
Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the project. Let me check if there's a justfile to understand the available commands:
Now I'll create the CLAUDE.md file with the project's workflow constraints and best practices for AI agents:
I need to check if the file exists first:
The file exists. Let me read it first:
Now I'll replace it with the comprehensive version:
Perfect! Now let me update the spec file to check off the acceptance criteria:
Now I'll check off all the acceptance criteria and add the model to the frontmatter:
Now let me check off the acceptance criteria:
Perfect! Now let me verify the build and tests pass:
Great! Now let's run the tests:
Excellent! Now let's build the project:
Perfect! Now let me create a commit for this work:
Excellent! Let me verify the final state:
Perfect! Let me verify the CLAUDE.md file looks good:
Perfect! The implementation is complete. Let me create a summary of what was done:

## Summary

I've successfully created a comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` file for the chant project that documents how AI agents should work with the codebase. Here's what was implemented:

### Deliverables ✅

**CLAUDE.md includes:**
- Overview of chant as an Intent Driven Development tool
- **Three Primary Rules** explicitly documented:
  1. Always use `just chant` for CLI operations
  2. Never touch the disk directly - only the chant CLI writes files
  3. Always use a spec for every operation
- **Core Commands** covering spec management, execution, and utilities
- **Development Commands** from the justfile (build, test, lint, fmt, etc.)
- **Project Structure** describing all key directories and files
- **Spec Format and Patterns** including filenames, frontmatter, types, and acceptance criteria
- **Important Constraints** for AI agents working on specs
- **Best Practices** for spec design, testing, and code quality
- **Workflow Example** showing the full process
- **Key Principles** (Auditability, Reproducibility, Isolation, Intention-driven, Idempotent)

### Acceptance Criteria ✅

- [x] CLAUDE.md exists in project root
- [x] Documents the three key constraints above
- [x] Includes common chant commands
- [x] Describes project structure
- [x] Explains spec workflow

### Verification ✅

- ✅ All linting passes (`just lint`)
- ✅ All 223 tests pass (`just test`)
- ✅ Binary builds successfully (`just build`)
- ✅ Changes committed with message: `chant(2026-01-24-01m-q7e): Author CLAUDE.md with comprehensive chant workflow guide`
- ✅ Spec marked as completed with model attribution```
