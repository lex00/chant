# Fix research-workflow test assertions to match updated spec format

## Problem

Both research-workflow assertions fail with "Research spec missing checkbox questions":
- `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/test-assertions.sh`
- `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/test-assertions.sh`

The spec format was updated during quality fixes and may have removed or changed checkbox format.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/test-assertions.sh` to check for acceptance criteria checkboxes instead of research question checkboxes
- [x] Update `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/test-assertions.sh` to check for acceptance criteria checkboxes instead of research question checkboxes
- [x] Run `./examples/test-examples.sh research-workflow` and verify all assertions pass with exit code 0

## Agent Output

```
I'll fix the research-workflow test assertions to match the updated spec format.
Both specs have "Acceptance Criteria" sections with checkboxes. The tests are checking for "checkbox questions" but should be checking for "Acceptance Criteria" checkboxes instead.
## Summary

Updated test assertions in both research-workflow example paths to check for "Acceptance Criteria" checkboxes instead of generic "checkbox questions".

- Changed test message from "checkbox questions" to "acceptance criteria checkboxes"
- Updated grep pattern to explicitly check for "## Acceptance Criteria" section
- All 6 tests pass in both academic-path and developer-path
- Verified with `./examples/test-examples.sh research-workflow` (exit code 0)```
