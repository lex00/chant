# Fix stale docs/README.md installation section

The `docs/README.md` installation section says "Coming soon" for Homebrew and Cargo, but both installation methods are fully working and documented in the root README.md.

## Tasks

1. Read current `docs/README.md` installation section (lines 84-91)
2. Read root `README.md` installation section as reference
3. Update `docs/README.md` to match root README or link to it
4. Remove all "Coming soon" placeholders

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] No "Coming soon" text in docs/README.md
- [x] Installation instructions match reality (Homebrew and Cargo both work)
- [x] Either full instructions or clear link to root README
