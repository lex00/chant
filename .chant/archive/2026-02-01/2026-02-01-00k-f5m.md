# Document all list command flags

The `list` command has many flags that are minimally documented. Users need to understand flag combinations.

## Tasks

1. Read list command definition in src/main.rs
2. Document all flags in `docs/reference/cli.md`:
   - `--ready` (filter to ready specs)
   - `--status` (filter by status)
   - `--global` (search all repos)
   - `--repo` (specific repo)
   - `--project` (project filter)
   - `--json` (JSON output)
   - `--limit` (max results)
3. Document common flag combinations
4. Add examples for each use case

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All list flags documented with descriptions
- [x] Flag combination examples (e.g., `--global --status in_progress`)
- [x] Clear explanation of `--global` vs `--repo` vs `--project`

## Agent Output

```
I'll document all list command flags. Let me start by reading the list command definition.
Test failure detected. Creating spec for investigation.
I noticed some issues with the spec. The flags mentioned in the spec don't match what I found in the code. Let me verify what flags are actually available and update the spec accordingly. Note: there's no `--json` or `--limit` flags in the code.
## Summary

Documented all list command flags in docs/reference/cli.md:

- Added comprehensive flag table with all 13 flags
- Documented cross-repository filtering (`--global`, `--repo`, `--project`)
- Added flag combination examples
- Removed references to non-existent `--json` and `--limit` flags from original spec

Note: Created spec 2026-02-01-00l-rya to investigate test_driver_auto_completes_with_real_commits test failure.```
