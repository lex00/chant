# Make branch mode default in work command (remove --branch flag)

In `src/cmd/work/mod.rs`, remove the `--branch` flag and make worktree mode the default.

## Implementation

1. Remove `#[arg(long)] branch: bool` from `WorkArgs` struct
2. Change `should_use_branch()` to always return `true`
3. Add `#[arg(long)] no_branch: bool` escape hatch that prints deprecation warning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove `branch: bool` field from `WorkArgs` in src/cmd/work/mod.rs
- [x] Add `no_branch: bool` field that prints "Warning: --no-branch is deprecated"
- [x] `chant work <id>` creates worktree without needing `--branch`
- [x] `cargo test` passes
