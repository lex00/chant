# Document --force flag for replaying completed specs

Add documentation for the `--force` flag that allows replaying completed specs (implemented in spec 00l-8a2).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `--force` to CLI reference under work command
- [x] Explain when to use --force (replay, verification)
- [x] Show example of replaying a completed spec
- [x] Note that replay is idempotent (agent detects existing implementation)

## Example Content

```bash
# Replay a completed spec to verify implementation
chant work 001 --force

# The agent will:
# 1. Detect the implementation already exists
# 2. Verify acceptance criteria are met
# 3. Append a new Agent Output section to the spec
# 4. Not create duplicate commits
```

## Implementation Notes

- Update docs/reference/cli.md in the "Execution" section
- The --force flag bypasses the "already completed" check
- Useful for: verification, re-running after prompt changes, testing
