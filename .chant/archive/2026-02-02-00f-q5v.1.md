# Standardize README structure across examples

Audit and standardize all 5 example READMEs to follow identical section structure.

### Inherited Context

- Examples must remain independently executable
- Documentation must clearly convey execution patterns

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All 5 READMEs have sections: Overview, Structure, Usage, Testing (in that order)
- [x] Each README documents its execution pattern (driver/chain/independent)
- [x] Section headers use consistent markdown formatting (## for main sections)
- [x] Overview section summarizes the example's purpose in 2-3 sentences
- [x] Structure section lists specs with their relationships

### Edge Cases

- Examples with different execution patterns: Ensure Usage section clearly indicates whether to use driver spec, chain, or independent execution
- Missing sections: Add placeholders for Testing section (to be filled by Member 4)

### Example Test Cases

Verify each README:
- approval-workflow: Documents 3 independent specs
- kpi-okr-workflow: Documents driver + member pattern
- tdd-workflow: Documents driver + member pattern
- research-workflow: Documents 2 independent paths
- oss-maintainer-workflow: Documents 6-spec sequential chain

## Agent Output

2026-02-02T13:46:54Z

```
I'll standardize the README structure across all 5 examples.
## Summary

Standardized all 5 example READMEs to follow identical section structure: Overview, Structure, Usage, Testing.

- All READMEs now use consistent ## markdown formatting for main sections
- Overview sections summarize purpose in 2-3 sentences
- Structure sections list specs with relationships and execution patterns
- Usage sections document how to run each example (driver/chain/independent)
- Testing sections provide verification steps

All acceptance criteria met and committed.```
