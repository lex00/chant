# Move status icon between ID and title in spec list output - Currently chant list shows status icon at start of line. Move it to appear after the spec ID but before the title, like: "001-bo4 ● Add InMemory..." instead of "● 001-bo4 Add InMemory...". Check src/cmd/list.rs or wherever list output is formatted.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Status icon appears after spec ID instead of before it
- [x] Output format matches: "ID icon title" instead of "icon ID title"
- [x] All list output uses new format consistently

## Agent Output

2026-02-05T08:03:45Z

```
I'll examine the current list output format and move the status icon to appear after the spec ID.
## Summary

Changed src/cmd/spec/list.rs to move status icon after spec ID in list output.

- Modified println! format string in list.rs:620-628
- Changed from `"{} {}{} {}{}"` (icon, id, approval, title, indicators) to `"{} {} {}{}{}"` (id, icon, title, approval, indicators)
- Output now shows "001-bo4 ● Add InMemory..." instead of "● 001-bo4 Add InMemory..."```
