# Add GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish to crates.io when a new release tag is pushed

## Target Files
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add a new job to the release workflow that publishes to crates.io
- [x] Job should depend on build-release to ensure builds succeed first
- [x] Job should use CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret for authentication
- [x] Workflow triggers on version tags (v*)

## Agent Output

2026-02-05T09:23:33Z

```
I'll implement the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish to crates.io when a new release tag is pushed.
## Summary

Added `publish-crates` job to `.github/workflows/release.yml` that runs after successful builds to automatically publish the package to crates.io when a release tag is pushed.

- Job depends on `build-release` to ensure builds succeed first
- Uses `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret for authentication
- Triggers on version tags matching `v*` pattern

All acceptance criteria met. Implementation committed with clean git status.```
