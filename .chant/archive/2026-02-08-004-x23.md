# Review Research workflow for accuracy

Check all commands, config examples, and feature references in the Research workflow docs against the current implementation. Fix stale references from recent pruning. Do not add new features.

## Checks to perform

- All `chant` commands shown exist and have correct flags
- Config examples use valid fields (no removed features)
- No references to hooks, webhooks, tantivy, log rotation, or autonomy decision levels
- Spec frontmatter examples use valid field names
- Drift detection examples match actual `chant drift` behavior

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Every `chant` command in the workflow docs is valid against current CLI
- [x] No stale feature references remain
- [x] Drift detection examples match actual implementation

## Agent Output

```
I'll review the Research workflow documentation for accuracy against the current implementation.
Issues found:

1. **Line 26**: `chant add "..." --type research` - `--type` flag doesn't exist
2. **Lines 182-207**: `schedule:` field references - field exists but no automation
3. **Lines 243-258**: `chant replay` command doesn't exist
4. **Line 398**: Reference to `autonomy.md` doc
## Summary

Fixed stale command and feature references in Research workflow documentation:

- Removed `--type` flag from `chant add` (doesn't exist)
- Replaced `chant replay` with `chant reset && chant work` pattern
- Clarified `schedule:` field is documentation-only, not automated
- Removed references to automated drift notifications and config
- Removed stale `autonomy.md` link

All commands now match current CLI implementation.```
