# Add missing config.md to oss-maintainer-workflow and research-workflow examples

## Problem

`chant work` fails with "Failed to read config from .chant/config.md" because these examples lack config files.

## Files to Create

- `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/.chant/config.md`
- `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/config.md`
- `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/config.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/.chant/config.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [x] `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/config.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [x] `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/config.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [x] Running `chant status` in each directory succeeds without config errors

```
I'll implement the missing config.md files for the examples.
The examples directory structure is different than expected. Let me navigate properly.
## Summary

Created config.md files for three example workflow directories.

- `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/.chant/config.md`
- `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/config.md`
- `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/config.md`

All configs use standard defaults. Verified `chant status` runs successfully in all three directories without config errors.```
