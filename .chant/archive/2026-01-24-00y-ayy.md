# Add just chant recipe for build and run

Add a `just chant` recipe that builds and runs chant, passing through arguments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `chant` recipe to justfile
- [x] Recipe builds with `cargo build`
- [x] Recipe runs `./target/debug/chant` with passed args
- [x] Works with any chant subcommand

## Example Usage

```bash
# Build and run chant status
just chant status

# Build and run chant work
just chant work 001

# Build and run chant list
just chant list --ready
```

## Justfile Recipe

```just
# Build and run chant with arguments
chant *ARGS:
    cargo build
    ./target/debug/chant {{ARGS}}
```

## Implementation Notes

- Simple recipe, just needs the `*ARGS` variadic parameter
- Ensures binary is always fresh before running
