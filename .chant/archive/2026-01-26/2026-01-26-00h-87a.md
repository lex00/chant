# Add auto-lint after split command completes

After `chant split` completes, automatically run `chant lint` on the resulting member specs to validate they pass complexity checks. Currently split shows complexity warnings inline but doesn't run the full lint validation.

## Context

When splitting a spec, the split command shows inline warnings like:
```
⚠ Member 4: 5 criteria, 2 files, 217 words (exceeds targets)
```

But after split completes, running `chant lint` still shows warnings on the driver spec because it retains the full content. Auto-linting after split would:
1. Validate all member specs pass lint rules
2. Provide immediate feedback if any member is too complex
3. Suggest further splitting if needed

## Expected Behavior

After split completes successfully:
```
✓ Split complete! Driver spec 2026-01-26-00e-lb2 is now type: group

Running lint on member specs...
✓ 2026-01-26-00e-lb2.1
✓ 2026-01-26-00e-lb2.2
⚠ 2026-01-26-00e-lb2.3: Spec has 6 acceptance criteria (>5)
    → Consider: chant split 2026-01-26-00e-lb2.3

All 7 members created. 1 warning.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] After split creates member specs, lint is automatically run on them
- [ ] Lint output shows which members pass/warn/fail
- [ ] Driver spec is excluded from lint (it's now a group, not executable)
- [ ] Exit code reflects lint results (non-zero if errors)
- [ ] `just lint` passes with no warnings

## Notes

- Only lint the newly created member specs, not all specs
- Consider adding `--no-lint` flag to skip auto-lint if needed
- The driver spec should not trigger complexity warnings after conversion to group type
