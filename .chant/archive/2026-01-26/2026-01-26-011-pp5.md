# Audit and update documentation with recent features

## Overview

Several new features have been added recently that need documentation:

### New Commands
- `chant drift` - Detect stale inputs in documentation/research specs
- `chant resume` - Retry failed specs (reset to pending, optionally re-execute)
- `chant export` - Export specs to JSON, CSV, or Markdown with filtering
- `chant disk` - Show disk usage of chant artifacts

### Enhanced Commands
- `chant merge --rebase` - Rebase branches before ff-merge (for parallel branches)
- `chant merge --auto` - Agent-assisted conflict resolution
- `chant work <id1> <id2> ...` - Multi-ID support for selective parallel execution

### Infrastructure
- Branch prefix now uses config consistently (no more hardcoded "spec/")
- merge-conflict.md prompt template for conflict resolution
- Unified ID matching across all commands

## Changes Made

### docs/reference/cli.md
- Added `chant work 001 002 003 --parallel` to Execution section
- Added full Merge section with --rebase and --auto documentation
- Added Resume section
- Added Drift section with example output
- Added Export section with filtering and field selection
- Added Disk section with example output
- Updated Parallel Execution section with selective multi-ID support

### docs/concepts/prompts.md
- Added `merge-conflict` and `parallel-cleanup` to Built-in Prompts table
- Added Utility Prompts subsection explaining merge-conflict.md and parallel-cleanup.md

### docs/guides/recovery.md
- Updated merge conflict recovery options to use new --rebase --auto workflow
- Added chant resume as recovery option

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] docs/commands.md updated with new commands (drift, resume, export, disk)
- [x] docs/commands.md updated with new merge flags (--rebase, --auto)
- [x] docs/parallel.md updated with multi-ID work support
- [x] docs/configuration.md updated if any new config options (N/A - no new config)
- [x] docs/prompts.md updated with merge-conflict.md template
- [x] README.md updated if needed for new features (already mentions drift detection)
- [x] Check all code examples are current
