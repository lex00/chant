# Remove stale "branch: false" from init config generation

`src/main.rs:2315` writes `branch: false` into `.chant/config.md` during `chant init`, but the `branch` boolean field was removed from `DefaultsConfig` — chant is always in branch/worktree mode now. The stale line should be removed from the init config generation so new projects don't get a dead config key.
