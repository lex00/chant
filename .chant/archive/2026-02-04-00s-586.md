# Relax spec body length lint warning

## Problem

The 50-word threshold for spec body length triggers too often. Detailed AC and examples actually help agents succeed - penalizing longer specs is counterproductive.

## Solution

Increase the word count threshold or remove this check entirely. Detailed specs with examples are good.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Find the word count check in `src/lint.rs` (search for "50" or "words")
- [x] Increase threshold from 50 to 150 words, or remove the warning entirely
- [x] Run `cargo build` and confirm zero errors

## Agent Output

2026-02-04T22:13:34Z

```
I'll search for the word count check in the lint module and adjust the threshold.
## Summary

Changed `src/config/defaults.rs` to increase the complexity_words threshold from 50 to 150 words.

- Updated default threshold constant from 50 to 150
- Updated documentation comment to reflect new default
- Confirmed build succeeds with `cargo build````
