# Add group-aware progress reporting to chain and parallel modes
## Problem
Chain and parallel modes have minimal progress output. When running through spec groups, there's no visibility into which group is active, how many members are done within it, or overall progress across groups.

## Solution
Add structured progress reporting to both chain and parallel execution:
- Print group context when starting a group: `Starting group <driver_id> (<title>) — N members`
- Print per-member completion within group context: `[group 2/5] [member 3/4] ✓ completed <id>`
- Print group completion: `✓ Group <driver_id> completed (4/4 members)`
- Print running tally after each completion: `[N/total] completed, M failed, K remaining, J running`
- On group failure, summarize: which members completed, which failed, which were skipped
- Standalone specs report outside group context: `[standalone] ✓ completed <id>`

Key files:
- `src/cmd/work/chain.rs` — `print_chain_summary`, progress bar, chain loop
- `src/cmd/work/parallel.rs` — parallel progress reporting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Chain prints group name and member count when starting a group
- [ ] Chain prints per-member progress with group context (e.g. `[group 2/5] [member 3/4]`)
- [ ] Chain prints overall running tally after each spec completes
- [ ] Chain prints group summary on group completion or partial failure
- [ ] Parallel prints equivalent group-aware progress
- [ ] Existing tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes
