# Split command produces more descriptive spec titles instead of terse ones

## Problem

When `chant split` generates member specs, the titles are too terse/abbreviated. Good titles help agents understand what to do.

## Solution

Update the split prompt in `prompts/split.md` to instruct the LLM to generate more descriptive titles:
- Titles should be 5-15 words
- Should describe the specific change, not just category
- Bad: "Add tests"
- Good: "Add unit tests for user authentication flow"

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update `prompts/split.md` to require descriptive 5-15 word titles
- [x] Add examples of good vs bad titles in the prompt

## Agent Output

```
I'll implement the changes to make split command generate more descriptive spec titles.
## Summary

Updated `prompts/split.md` to require more descriptive spec titles (5-15 words) with examples of good vs bad titles.

- Added title length requirement (5-15 words)
- Added guidance to describe the specific change, not just category
- Included concrete examples showing good titles ("Add unit tests for user authentication flow") vs bad titles ("Add tests")

All acceptance criteria met and committed.```
