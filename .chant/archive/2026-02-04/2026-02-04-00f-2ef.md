# Add .chant/processes/ to .gitignore during chant init to ignore runtime process files

## Problem

The `.chant/processes/` folder contains runtime process tracking files that shouldn't be committed.

## Solution

In `src/main.rs` where `chant init` updates `.gitignore`, add `.chant/processes/` to the ignored patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Find gitignore update logic in init code and add `.chant/processes/` pattern
- [x] New projects get `.chant/processes/` in their .gitignore after init

## Agent Output

2026-02-04T18:54:00Z

```
I'll implement the changes to add `.chant/processes/` to `.gitignore` during `chant init`.
## Summary

Changed `src/main.rs` to add `processes/` to the `.gitignore` content created during `chant init`.

- Added `processes/` to the gitignore patterns list at line 2203
- All clippy checks pass
- All acceptance criteria met```
