# Clean up prompts and remove unused cleanup config

## Tasks

### 1. Delete orphan prompts from `prompts/`
These are in the folder but not bundled (no include_str!):
- `prompts/triage.md`
- `prompts/reproduce.md`
- `prompts/research.md`
- `prompts/implement.md`
- `prompts/review.md`
- `prompts/document.md`

### 2. Merge output-concise into standard prompt
Append the content from `.chant/prompts/extensions/output-concise.md` to `prompts/standard.md` (the bundled version).

### 3. Remove parallel-cleanup prompt
- Delete `prompts/parallel-cleanup.md`
- Remove from `src/prompts.rs`: the PARALLEL_CLEANUP const and its PromptMetadata entry

### 4. Remove CleanupConfig from code
- `src/config/defaults.rs`: Remove CleanupConfig struct, its Default impl, and the `cleanup` field from ParallelConfig
- `src/cmd/work/parallel.rs`: Remove cleanup config references at lines ~1221-1254, just keep pitfall detection and always print message
- `src/cmd/config.rs`: Remove cleanup prompt validation (~lines 120-133)
- `src/config/tests.rs`: Remove cleanup-related test assertions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Delete 6 orphan prompt files from `prompts/`
- [x] Add output-concise rules to end of `prompts/standard.md`
- [x] Remove `parallel-cleanup.md` and its references in `src/prompts.rs`
- [x] Remove CleanupConfig and all references in src/config/ and src/cmd/
- [x] `cargo test` passes

## Agent Output

2026-02-04T17:22:43Z

```
I'll implement this spec to clean up prompts and remove unused cleanup config.
## Summary

Cleaned up prompts and removed unused cleanup config across 16 files.

- Deleted 7 orphan/unused prompt files (triage, reproduce, research, implement, review, document, parallel-cleanup)
- Merged output-concise extension into prompts/standard.md
- Removed CleanupConfig struct and all references from config, parallel work, and tests
- Fixed clippy warnings in agent_rotation tests and mcp_protocol test

All tests pass and git status is clean.```
