# Add chant_spec_get tool to MCP server

Add the `chant_spec_get` tool to the MCP server to retrieve detailed information about a specific spec.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `chant_spec_get` tool to the tools/list response
- [x] Implement the tool to return full spec details including frontmatter and body
- [x] Accept `id` parameter (required) that can be a full or partial spec ID
- [x] Return error if spec is not found

## Tool Schema

```json
{
  "name": "chant_spec_get",
  "description": "Get details of a chant spec",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Spec ID (full or partial)"
      }
    },
    "required": ["id"]
  }
}
```

## Agent Output

2026-01-24T12:20:08Z

```
The spec has been implemented and verified. The `chant_spec_get` tool was already present in `src/mcp.rs` and fully functional:

1. **Tool listed in tools/list** - Lines 183-195 define the tool schema
2. **Returns full spec details** - Lines 334-348 return all frontmatter fields plus body
3. **Accepts partial ID** - Uses `resolve_spec()` which handles partial matching
4. **Returns error if not found** - Lines 319-332 handle the not-found case with `isError: true`

All acceptance criteria have been checked off and the commit has been made.```
