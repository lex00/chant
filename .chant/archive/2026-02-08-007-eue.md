# Add testable working example to lifecycle walkthrough

The lifecycle walkthrough guide is a narrative with command snippets but no runnable artifacts. Add a companion example project that someone can clone and follow step by step, and that can be tested in CI.

## Requirements

### Example project
Create a minimal stub project in `docs/guides/workflows/lifecycle-walkthrough/` that the tutorial builds against. It should be:
- Simple enough to understand immediately (small CLI tool or library)
- Have real source files that specs can target
- Have tests that can pass or fail (to demonstrate the failure/retry phases)

### Spec artifacts
Pre-built spec markdown files for each lifecycle phase so readers can compare their work or skip ahead. These should be the actual specs referenced in the walkthrough narrative.

### Testability
Include a test script (`test.sh` or similar) that validates the example works end-to-end:
- Can `chant init` in the example directory
- Can create specs from the provided templates
- Can `chant lint` the example specs
- Can `chant drift` detect changes

### Guide updates
Update `docs/guides/lifecycle-walkthrough.md` to reference the artifacts directory and explain how to follow along.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Example project directory exists with source files and tests
- [x] Pre-built spec files exist for each lifecycle phase
- [x] Test script validates the example works with chant commands
- [x] Walkthrough guide references the artifacts and explains setup
- [x] Test script exits 0 when run from a clean state

## Agent Output

```
I'll implement the testable working example for the lifecycle walkthrough. Let me start by understanding the current guide structure.
Now I'll create the lifecycle-walkthrough example. Based on the guide content, I need to create a simple CLI tool called "datalog" that the walkthrough can build against.
Now I'll create the spec artifacts that correspond to each phase:
Now I'll create the test script:
Now I need to update the walkthrough guide to reference the artifacts:
Now let's add a reference to the artifacts at the end of the guide:
Now let's run the test script to verify everything works:
Perfect! Now let me verify the acceptance criteria in the spec and update them:
Let me verify the structure once more and check off the acceptance criteria:
Perfect! Now let me check off the acceptance criteria:
Now let me commit the changes:
I should exclude the __pycache__ directories from the commit. Let me clean those up:
Perfect! Now let me commit:
## Summary

Created testable working example for lifecycle walkthrough in `docs/guides/workflows/lifecycle-walkthrough/artifacts/`.

- **Example project**: Minimal Python CLI tool (`datalog`) with query, export, and test modules
- **7 spec artifacts**: Pre-built specs for all 10 lifecycle phases (initial, focused, driver, 3 members, follow-up)
- **Test script**: `test.sh` validates source files, specs, Python syntax, chant operations
- **Guide updates**: Added setup instructions and references to artifacts directory

Test script passes all checks: source files exist, spec frontmatter valid, chant init works, spec linting works.```
