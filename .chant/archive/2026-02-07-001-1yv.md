# Rename "Codebase Sprawl" to "Impact Map" across OSS maintainer workflow

## Context

User feedback from real-world usage: "Codebase Sprawl sounds like a problem to avoid, not a research activity. Something like Impact Mapping or Change Surface Analysis would communicate the intent more clearly — you're mapping what the fix will touch."

## Task

Rename all references to "Codebase Sprawl" / "Sprawl" (as a stage name) to "Impact Map" / "Impact Mapping" across the OSS maintainer workflow docs and example. This includes file names, headings, body text, YAML fields, cross-references, and the navigation table in index.md.

Do NOT rename the archived example spec files (those are historical artifacts). Do rename the doc page filename from `04-sprawl.md` to `04-impact-map.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/04-sprawl.md` renamed to `04-impact-map.md`
- [x] All headings and body text in the renamed file use "Impact Map" instead of "Sprawl"
- [x] `index.md` workflow table, guide pages list, and key concepts updated to say "Impact Map"
- [x] Cross-references in `03-root-cause.md` and `05-fork-fix.md` updated to point to `04-impact-map.md`
- [x] `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/README.md` updated to use "Impact Map" terminology
- [x] No broken internal links between doc pages
