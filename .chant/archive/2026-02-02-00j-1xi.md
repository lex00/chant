# Clean up approval-workflow example after accidental spec execution

## Problem

Running tests accidentally executed `002-approved-feature` spec, which created real files:
- `src/rateLimiter.js`
- `API_RATE_LIMITS.md`
- `test/rateLimiter.test.js`
- Modified `src/example.js`

The example should be a static demonstration of approval workflow structure, not an executed project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove generated files: `src/rateLimiter.js`, `API_RATE_LIMITS.md`, `test/rateLimiter.test.js`
- [x] Restore `src/example.js` to original state (remove rate limiter imports/middleware)
- [x] Reset `002-approved-feature.md` spec status to `pending` (keep approval metadata)
- [x] Example directory only contains demonstration structure, no generated code

## Agent Output

```
I'll clean up the approval-workflow example by removing the generated files and restoring the original state.
## Summary

Restored approval-workflow example to demonstration state by removing generated code.

- Deleted `src/rateLimiter.js`, `API_RATE_LIMITS.md`, `test/rateLimiter.test.js`
- Restored `src/example.js` to original state (removed rate limiter imports)
- Reset `002-approved-feature.md` status to `pending` with approval metadata preserved
- All tests passing, git status clean```
