# Add Decomposition gate after Comprehension for umbrella issues

## Context

User feedback: "No guidance for when the issue is actually multiple bugs. #38109 turned out to be an umbrella containing at least 5 distinct bugs. The workflow assumes one issue = one root cause = one fix. It would benefit from an explicit Triage/Decomposition step after Comprehension."

## Task

Add a "Decomposition" checkpoint to `01-comprehension.md` (as a section at the end, after exit criteria) and reference it from `index.md`. This is not a new full stage — it's a decision gate: "If comprehension reveals multiple distinct bugs under one issue, decompose before proceeding."

Include guidance on how to decompose (create separate spec chains per bug, or a driver spec), and when NOT to decompose (single root cause, related symptoms of one bug).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `01-comprehension.md` has a "Decomposition Gate" section after exit criteria
- [x] Section explains when to decompose (multiple distinct bugs) vs when not to (single root cause with multiple symptoms)
- [x] Provides concrete guidance: create separate spec chains per distinct bug, pick which to pursue first
- [x] `index.md` mentions the decomposition gate in the workflow summary
