# Add time-boxing and pivot guidance to OSS maintainer workflow

## Context

User feedback: "No guidance on when to abandon a theory. The workflow says to find the root cause but doesn't help with the meta-question: I've spent 4 hours on this angle and haven't found it — should I pivot? Having explicit criteria for when to step back and re-evaluate would help, especially for agents that might dig deeper and deeper into a dead end."

## Task

Add pivot/time-boxing guidance to `03-root-cause.md` (as a section near hypothesis elimination) and to `08-advanced.md` (as a general investigation pattern). Not time estimates — decision heuristics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `03-root-cause.md` has a "When to Pivot" section with decision heuristics
- [x] Heuristics include: N hypotheses tested without narrowing, stuck in one code path too long, re-read issue thread for missed clues
- [x] `08-advanced.md` has a general "Investigation Heuristics" section covering pivot decisions
- [x] Guidance is framed as decision points, not time estimates
