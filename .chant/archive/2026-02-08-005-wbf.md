# Review TDD workflow for accuracy

Check all commands, config examples, and feature references in the TDD workflow docs against the current implementation. Fix stale references from recent pruning. Do not add new features.

## Checks to perform

- All `chant` commands shown exist and have correct flags
- Config examples use valid fields (no removed features)
- No references to hooks, webhooks/slack, tantivy, log rotation, or autonomy decision levels
- Spec frontmatter examples use valid field names
- Lint and validation examples match current output format

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Every `chant` command in the workflow docs is valid against current CLI
- [x] No stale feature references (especially slack/webhook refs)
- [x] Lint/validation examples match current output format

## Agent Output

```
I'll review the TDD workflow documentation for accuracy against the current implementation.
## Summary

Fixed TDD workflow documentation to match current CLI implementation.

- Removed `--type` flag from `chant add` (type set in frontmatter)
- Fixed `chant work --parallel` usage (now uses spec IDs or --chain)
- Removed invalid `--follow` and `--format` flags
- Changed `--all` to `--all-completed` for merge command  
- Replaced non-existent `chant report` with `activity`/`export`
- Removed invalid drift command flags

All commands validated against `chant --help` output.```
