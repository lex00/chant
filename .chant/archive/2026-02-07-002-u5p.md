# Sharpen Comprehension stage exit criteria

## Context

User feedback: "Comprehension is too vague as a stage. The guide doesn't distinguish between reading the issue thread, reproducing symptoms, reading prior PRs, and reading code. It wasn't clear when Comprehension was done versus when we'd actually started Root Cause work."

Proposed framing: "Comprehension is complete when you can state the observable symptom, list the affected code areas, and describe what prior work exists. You should NOT have a hypothesis yet."

## Task

Update `01-comprehension.md` to add a precise "Exit Criteria" section that defines what the investigator should know (and should NOT know) before moving to the next stage. Also update `index.md` workflow table description to match.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `01-comprehension.md` has a new "Exit Criteria" section with explicit checklist of what must be known
- [x] Exit criteria explicitly state the investigator should NOT have a root cause hypothesis yet
- [x] The four sub-activities are named: read issue thread, review prior PRs/attempts, read affected code, document observable symptoms
- [x] `index.md` workflow table description for Comprehension updated to reflect sharper definition
