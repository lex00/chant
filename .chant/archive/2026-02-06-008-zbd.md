# Add concurrency section to docs/reference/git.md

## Context
Users may run multiple `chant work` in separate tabs, causing merge races. Document the safe pattern (`--parallel`) and the risk.

## Changes

In `docs/reference/git.md`, add a "Concurrency" section after the existing "Worktree Mode" section. Cover: worktree isolation is safe, but merge-back races when two specs finish simultaneously (both do `git checkout main && git merge` in the main repo). Safe approach is `chant work --parallel` which sequences merges. Watch mode has a PID lock so only one runs. Keep it concise — one section with a warning callout.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `docs/reference/git.md` has a Concurrency section explaining merge race risk and recommending `--parallel`
- [x] `cargo test` still passes (no code changes, just docs)
