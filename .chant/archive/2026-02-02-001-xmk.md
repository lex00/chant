```
I'll fix the unused `mut` warning in src/prompts.rs:57.
## Summary

Removed unused `mut` warning in src/prompts.rs:57 by restructuring the conditional compilation block.

- Removed `mut` from initial `prompts` declaration (line 57)
- Created mutable shadow binding only within `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` block
- All clippy warnings resolved, code compiles cleanly```
