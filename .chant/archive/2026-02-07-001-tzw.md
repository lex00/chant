# Bug: Chain mode skips initial spec due to status race condition. When chant work --chain starts, it marks the target spec as in_progress before the worker loop begins. The worker then calls get_ready_specs() which only returns pending specs, so the initial spec (already in_progress) is skipped. The chain advances to the next pending/ready spec instead. Observed: no worktree, no log, no PID file created for the initial spec, but subsequent specs in the chain work fine. Fix: either (1) the worker should process the explicitly-requested spec first before entering the ready-spec loop, or (2) delay the in_progress status update until the worker actually begins working the spec. Check src/cmd/work/chain.rs and src/cmd/work/single.rs for the ordering of status update vs worker dispatch.
