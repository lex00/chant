# Move unimplemented features to roadmap section

## Problem

The main documentation contains extensive sections describing features that are not yet implemented. This creates confusion for users who encounter detailed documentation about features they cannot use. Per the earlier audit, we have:

- **7 fully unimplemented feature docs** with "Not Implemented ❌" banners
- **9 partially implemented docs** with sections describing unimplemented features
- **1 error**: Export falsely marked as not implemented

**User experience issue**: Users reading the main docs expect to learn about features they can use today, not features planned for the future.

## Solution

**Restructure documentation to focus on implemented features:**

1. Move fully unimplemented feature docs to `docs/roadmap/planned/`
2. Remove unimplemented sections from partially implemented docs
3. Add brief "See roadmap" references where appropriate
4. Fix the export documentation error
5. Update SUMMARY.md to have a clear "Planned Features" section

## Files to Move (7 files)

Move these complete files to `docs/roadmap/planned/`:

1. `docs/scale/daemon.md` → `docs/roadmap/planned/daemon.md`
2. `docs/scale/metrics.md` → `docs/roadmap/planned/metrics.md`
3. `docs/concepts/hooks.md` → `docs/roadmap/planned/hooks.md`
4. `docs/concepts/triggers.md` → `docs/roadmap/planned/triggers.md`
5. `docs/guides/approvals.md` → `docs/roadmap/planned/approvals.md`
6. `docs/reference/costs.md` → `docs/roadmap/planned/costs.md`
7. `docs/reference/notifications.md` → `docs/roadmap/planned/notifications.md`

│       ├── README.md (index of planned features)
│       ├── daemon.md (moved from scale/)
│       ├── metrics.md (moved from scale/)

## SUMMARY.md Updates

Add new section after Roadmap:

```markdown
# Roadmap
- [Roadmap](roadmap/roadmap.md)
- [Feature Status](FEATURE_STATUS.md)

# Planned Features
- [Overview](roadmap/planned/README.md)
- [Daemon Mode](roadmap/planned/daemon.md)
- [Metrics](roadmap/planned/metrics.md)
- [Hooks](roadmap/planned/hooks.md)
- [Triggers](roadmap/planned/triggers.md)
- [Approvals](roadmap/planned/approvals.md)
- [Cost Tracking](roadmap/planned/costs.md)
- [Notifications](roadmap/planned/notifications.md)
```

Remove these entries from their current locations in SUMMARY.md.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Export error fixed in lifecycle.md (remove "not implemented" marker)
- [x] 7 unimplemented feature docs moved to docs/roadmap/planned/
- [x] docs/roadmap/planned/README.md created as index
- [x] 12 files edited to remove unimplemented sections
- [x] All edited files have brief "See roadmap" references where appropriate
- [x] SUMMARY.md updated with new Planned Features section
- [x] SUMMARY.md entries removed from original locations
- [x] All cross-references updated to point to new locations
- [x] No broken links in documentation
- [x] Main docs focus exclusively on implemented features
- [x] Roadmap section clearly labeled as "Planned Features"
- [x] FEATURE_STATUS.md updated to reflect new file locations

## Implementation Notes

**Order of operations:**
1. Create `docs/roadmap/planned/` directory
2. Create `docs/roadmap/planned/README.md` index file
3. Move 7 complete feature docs to planned/
4. Edit 12 files to remove unimplemented sections
5. Update SUMMARY.md
6. Update FEATURE_STATUS.md file paths
7. Verify no broken links with `mdbook build docs`

**README.md content:**
```markdown
