# Fix KPI/OKR terminology confusion in enterprise guide

## Problem

The KPI/OKR enterprise guide uses "KPI" and "OKR" interchangeably, creating confusion about the difference:

**Current issues:**
1. README says "Q1 **OKR**: reduce churn 8%→5%" then later shows "**KPI Definition**" for the same thing
2. Guide uses "KPI project" when it should be "OKR initiative"
3. Not clear that KPI = metric, OKR = goal framework targeting that metric

**The correct distinction:**
- **KPI** (Key Performance Indicator) = The ongoing metric being tracked
  - Example: Churn rate, NPS score, activation rate
  - Exists before, during, and after any OKR

- **OKR** (Objectives and Key Results) = Quarterly goal framework
  - **Objective**: Qualitative goal (e.g., "Improve customer retention")
  - **Key Result**: Quantitative target (e.g., "Reduce churn rate from 8% to 5%")
  - Time-bound (Q1 2026)

**The story should be:**
- Acme tracks churn rate as an ongoing **KPI**
- Q1 **OKR** sets a target to improve that **KPI** from 8%→5%
- The **Key Result** is the target for the **KPI**

## Solution

Update the guide to use terms correctly and consistently:

1. **README.md changes:**
   - Change title section from "KPI Definition" to "Q1 OKR"
   - Show Objective + Key Result structure
   - Clarify: "This OKR targets improving the churn rate KPI"

2. **01-scenario.md changes:**
   - Keep existing Q1 OKR section (it's already correct!)
   - Rename "Success Metrics" to "KPIs Being Tracked"
   - Add clarifying text about OKR vs KPI relationship

3. **Throughout guide:**
   - "KPI project" → "OKR initiative" or "churn reduction project"
   - Keep "Daily KPI tracking" (correct - tracking the metric)
   - "kpi-churn" label can stay (just a label)
   - Add a terminology callout box explaining the difference

4. **Add terminology section:**
   Create a clear explanation of OKR vs KPI at the start
