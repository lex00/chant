# Update OSS maintainer workflow example to match doc changes

## Context

Specs 001-006 updated the OSS maintainer workflow docs with: renamed Sprawl→Impact Map, sharpened comprehension exit criteria, hypothesis elimination deliverable, decomposition gate, single-spec mode, and pivot guidance. The example source must be updated to match and the test script must pass.

## Task

Update the example at `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/` to reflect all doc changes:

1. Rename `004-sprawl` references to `004-impact-map` in spec files and research outputs
2. Rename `.chant/research/issue-42-sprawl.md` to `.chant/research/issue-42-impact-map.md`
3. Update all `informed_by` and `depends_on` references across specs
4. Update README.md to reflect new terminology and any new stages mentioned
5. Update `test-assertions.sh` to validate against new filenames (`004-impact-map.md` not `004-sprawl.md`)
6. Ensure the example specs in `.chant/specs/` (not archive) exist and are consistent
7. Run `bash examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/test-assertions.sh` and verify it passes

Note: Archive files are historical — update their content references but do not rename the archive directories themselves.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.chant/specs/004-sprawl.md` renamed to `.chant/specs/004-impact-map.md` in example
- [x] `.chant/research/issue-42-sprawl.md` renamed to `.chant/research/issue-42-impact-map.md` in example
- [x] All spec `informed_by` and `target_files` references updated to use new filenames
- [x] `README.md` uses "Impact Map" terminology
- [x] `test-assertions.sh` checks for `004-impact-map.md` not `004-sprawl.md`
- [x] `bash examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/test-assertions.sh` exits 0
