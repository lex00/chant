# Update KPI-OKR reporting guide to clarify external scheduling

## Problem

The reporting guide (06-reporting.md) implies chant has built-in scheduling:

1. Shows a `.chant/cron.yaml` config file that doesn't exist in the implementation
2. Uses `schedule: daily` field as if it triggers automatic execution
3. Frames scheduling as a chant feature rather than external integration

This creates confusion when users try to set up scheduled reports and find no
`.chant/cron.yaml` support.

## Solution

Reframe the scheduling section to:

1. Remove the fictional `.chant/cron.yaml` example
2. Keep the GitHub Actions example (it's correct - external tool calling chant)
3. Add a standard crontab example as an alternative
4. Clarify that `schedule:` is a metadata/documentation field for human reference
5. Frame as "integrating chant with your existing automation tools"

The `schedule:` field can stay in the spec example as documentation (it indicates
intent), but the prose should clarify that execution is triggered externally.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove `.chant/cron.yaml` section (lines 63-77)
- [x] Rename section from "Cron Configuration" to "Scheduling with External Tools"
- [x] Add intro text explaining chant is triggered by external schedulers
- [x] Add standard crontab example alongside GitHub Actions
- [x] Update spec example to clarify `schedule:` is metadata, not a trigger
- [x] Keep GitHub Actions example (it's correct)
- [x] Ensure the guide still flows well narratively

```
I'll start by reading the relevant file to understand the current state and plan my approach.
Let me search for the reporting guide file.
Now I have a clear picture of the file. Let me also read the spec file to understand my task and check off the criteria as I complete them.
Now I'll implement the changes. I'll rewrite the scheduling section to remove the fictional `.chant/cron.yaml`, add proper explanatory text, add a crontab example, and clarify that `schedule:` is metadata.
Let me make the edits. First, I'll update the spec example to add a comment clarifying that `schedule:` is metadata, then I'll replace the entire "Cron Configuration" section.
Let me read the updated file to verify the changes and check the narrative flow.
The changes look good. All acceptance criteria are met:
1. Removed `.chant/cron.yaml` section
2. Renamed section to "Scheduling with External Tools"
3. Added intro text explaining chant is triggered externally
4. Added standard crontab example
5. Updated spec example with metadata comment
6. Kept the GitHub Actions example
7. The guide flows well narratively
Now let me check off the acceptance criteria in the spec file.
Now let me commit the changes.
All tasks completed successfully. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Changes made to `docs/guides/enterprise/kpi-okr/06-reporting.md`:**

1. Added comment to the spec example clarifying `schedule: daily` is metadata, not a trigger (line 44)
2. Renamed "Cron Configuration" section to "Scheduling with External Tools"
3. Added intro paragraph explaining that chant doesn't have built-in scheduling and the `schedule:` field is metadata
4. Added standard crontab example under new "Standard Crontab" subsection
5. Renamed the existing GitHub Actions section to a subsection under the new parent section
6. Removed the fictional `.chant/cron.yaml` example

**Changes made to `.chant/specs/2026-01-28-00k-wc7.md`:**
- Checked off all 7 acceptance criteria

The remaining unstaged changes are from other specs and are not related to this task. The commit `8e50c5c` contains only the files related to this spec.```
