# Update KPI-OKR reporting guide to clarify external scheduling

## Problem

The reporting guide (06-reporting.md) implies chant has built-in scheduling:

1. Shows a `.chant/cron.yaml` config file that doesn't exist in the implementation
2. Uses `schedule: daily` field as if it triggers automatic execution
3. Frames scheduling as a chant feature rather than external integration

This creates confusion when users try to set up scheduled reports and find no
`.chant/cron.yaml` support.

## Solution

Reframe the scheduling section to:

1. Remove the fictional `.chant/cron.yaml` example
2. Keep the GitHub Actions example (it's correct - external tool calling chant)
3. Add a standard crontab example as an alternative
4. Clarify that `schedule:` is a metadata/documentation field for human reference
5. Frame as "integrating chant with your existing automation tools"

The `schedule:` field can stay in the spec example as documentation (it indicates
intent), but the prose should clarify that execution is triggered externally.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove `.chant/cron.yaml` section (lines 63-77)
- [x] Rename section from "Cron Configuration" to "Scheduling with External Tools"
- [x] Add intro text explaining chant is triggered by external schedulers
- [x] Add standard crontab example alongside GitHub Actions
- [x] Update spec example to clarify `schedule:` is metadata, not a trigger
- [x] Keep GitHub Actions example (it's correct)
- [x] Ensure the guide still flows well narratively
