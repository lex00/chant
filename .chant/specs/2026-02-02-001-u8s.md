# Add codesign to macOS install process to prevent SIGKILL

## Problem

When copying the chant binary to `~/.local/bin/`, macOS strips the code signature. This causes macOS to kill the process with SIGKILL (exit 137) when running commands like `chant list`.

## Solution

After copying the binary on macOS, re-sign it with an ad-hoc signature:

```bash
codesign -f -s - ~/.local/bin/chant
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add codesign to release workflow for macOS builds (.github/workflows/release.yml:71)
- [x] Add codesign to Homebrew formula install (.github/workflows/release.yml:146)
- [x] Document codesign in installation docs with troubleshooting section
- [x] Codesign runs only on macOS (matrix.os == 'macos-latest' and OS.mac?)
