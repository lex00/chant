# Add codesign to macOS install process to prevent SIGKILL

## Problem

When copying the chant binary to `~/.local/bin/`, macOS strips the code signature. This causes macOS to kill the process with SIGKILL (exit 137) when running commands like `chant list`.

## Solution

After copying the binary on macOS, re-sign it with an ad-hoc signature:

```bash
codesign -f -s - ~/.local/bin/chant
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `codesign -f -s - $DEST` after `cp` in Makefile install target (macOS only)
- [x] Add codesign step to scripts/install.sh if it exists
- [x] Document the codesign requirement in installation docs
- [x] Use `uname -s` to detect macOS and only run codesign on Darwin
