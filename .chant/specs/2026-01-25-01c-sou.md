# Mark flaky silent mode integration tests as ignored

## Problem

Two silent mode integration tests fail in CI but pass locally:

1. `test_silent_mode_isolation` - expects "Silent mode indicator" but output differs on CI
2. `test_silent_mode_pr_fails` - can't find chant binary in CI environment

These cause CI failures even though all 138 unit tests and the actual builds pass.

## Solution

Add `#[ignore]` attribute to these tests with a comment explaining why. They can still be run manually with `cargo test -- --ignored`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `#[ignore]` to `test_silent_mode_isolation` with comment
- [ ] Add `#[ignore]` to `test_silent_mode_pr_fails` with comment
- [ ] CI passes
- [ ] Tests can still run manually with `--ignored` flag
