# Enforce use of "just chant" in CLAUDE.md

## Problem

The CLAUDE.md file should explicitly enforce using `just chant` instead of direct binary paths like `./target/debug/chant` or `cargo run`.

Using `just chant`:
- Ensures the binary is rebuilt if source changed
- Provides consistent interface
- Avoids stale binary issues

## Current State

CLAUDE.md mentions `just chant` but doesn't explicitly prohibit direct binary usage.

## Solution

Update CLAUDE.md to:
1. Explicitly state "Always use `just chant`, never `./target/debug/chant` or `cargo run`"
2. Add this to the "What NOT to do" section
3. Explain WHY (ensures fresh build, consistency)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLAUDE.md explicitly prohibits `./target/debug/chant` usage
- [ ] CLAUDE.md explicitly prohibits `cargo run -- ` usage
- [ ] Explanation of why `just chant` is required (rebuilds if needed)
- [ ] Added to "What NOT to do" section
- [ ] All existing `just chant` references remain correct
