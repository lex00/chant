# Extract lifecycle commands to src/cmd/lifecycle.rs

Move remaining lifecycle and utility commands. These are lower-volume but logically related functions.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All lifecycle command functions moved to `src/cmd/lifecycle.rs`:
  - `cmd_merge()`
  - `cmd_archive()`
  - `cmd_split()`
  - `cmd_diagnose()`
  - `cmd_log()`
  - `cmd_log_at()`
  - `lookup_log_file()`
  - All branch/PR operation helpers
- [ ] Public API exports all commands as pub fn
- [ ] `src/main.rs` dispatches lifecycle commands to `cmd::lifecycle`
- [ ] Branch and PR operations still work correctly
- [ ] Spec merging logic preserved
- [ ] Spec splitting with member creation works correctly
- [ ] Diagnostics and logging unchanged
- [ ] `just check` passes

### Edge Cases

- **Log file discovery**: Ensure log file lookup still finds spec execution logs in correct locations
- **Branch operations**: Verify branch creation and PR operations work with new module
- **Spec splitting**: Check that split operations create member specs correctly with proper numbering
- **Archive logic**: Confirm archive operations still move specs properly
- **Diagnosis output**: Verify diagnostic information is complete and correctly formatted

### Example Test Cases

For lifecycle commands, verify:
- `cmd_log()` finds and displays spec execution logs correctly
- `cmd_split()` creates member specs with correct numbering (e.g., spec.1, spec.2)
- `cmd_merge()` correctly handles completed specs ready for merging
- `cmd_archive()` moves specs to archive directory
- `cmd_diagnose()` produces detailed diagnostic information
- Branch creation and PR operations still function correctly
