# Docs: Move silent mode earlier and make prominent in OSS workflow guide

## Problem
Silent mode is buried in `08-advanced.md` but is critical for OSS maintainers who want personal spec workflow on shared repos.

## Solution
1. Create `00-setup.md` OR add prominent section to `index.md`
2. Move silent mode configuration to early setup section
3. Explain WHY OSS maintainers want silent mode:
   - Personal workflow on shared repos
   - Specs don't clutter team's git history
   - Still works locally, just not tracked
4. Show complete setup example:
   ```bash
   chant init
   chant silent  # Keep .chant/ local
   ```
5. Include config.yaml example with silent + branch settings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Silent mode documented in early setup section (not buried in advanced)
- [ ] Clear rationale for OSS maintainers
- [ ] Complete setup example with commands
- [ ] Config.yaml snippet showing silent: true, branch: false, main_branch
