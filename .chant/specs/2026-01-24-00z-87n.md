# Tag AI model used in spec frontmatter

Record which AI model was used to complete each spec in the frontmatter.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `model` field to spec frontmatter schema
- [x] Capture model from agent/environment when completing spec
- [x] Store in frontmatter on completion (e.g., `model: claude-3-opus`)
- [x] Document the field in specs.md

## Example Frontmatter

## Implementation Notes

- Model could come from:
  - Environment variable (e.g., `CHANT_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`)
  - Claude CLI output (if it reports model used)
  - Config default
- Store as simple string in frontmatter
- Useful for:
  - Tracking which model versions produced which work
  - Cost analysis
  - Debugging model-specific issues
