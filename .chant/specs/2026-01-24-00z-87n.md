# Tag AI model used in spec frontmatter

Record which AI model was used to complete each spec in the frontmatter.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `model` field to spec frontmatter schema
- [ ] Capture model from agent/environment when completing spec
- [ ] Store in frontmatter on completion (e.g., `model: claude-3-opus`)
- [ ] Document the field in specs.md

## Example Frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: code
status: completed
commit: abc1234
completed_at: 2026-01-24T15:30:00Z
model: claude-3-opus
---
```

## Implementation Notes

- Model could come from:
  - Environment variable (e.g., `CHANT_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`)
  - Claude CLI output (if it reports model used)
  - Config default
- Store as simple string in frontmatter
- Useful for:
  - Tracking which model versions produced which work
  - Cost analysis
  - Debugging model-specific issues
