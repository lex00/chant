# Create research-synthesis prompt for combining multiple sources

Create the `research-synthesis` prompt that guides agents to synthesize multiple sources into coherent findings.

## Context

Research-synthesis specs combine multiple sources:

```yaml
---
type: research
prompt: research-synthesis
informed_by:
  - papers/smith2025.pdf
  - papers/jones2024.pdf
  - docs/prior-analysis.md
target_files:
  - findings/comparison.md
---
```

The agent needs guidance to:
1. Read and understand all source materials
2. Identify themes, patterns, agreements, conflicts
3. Synthesize into unified findings
4. Make clear recommendations

## Prompt Content

The prompt should include:

### Principles
- **Comprehensive** — Consider all sources
- **Comparative** — Note agreements and conflicts
- **Analytical** — Draw conclusions from evidence
- **Actionable** — Provide clear recommendations

### Process
1. Read all files in `informed_by:`
2. Identify key themes and patterns across sources
3. Note conflicts, gaps, or disagreements
4. Synthesize into unified findings
5. Answer Research Questions with citations
6. Produce output in `target_files:`

### For Literature Review
- Summarize each source
- Create comparison tables
- Identify research gaps
- Make recommendations

### For Library Comparison
- List pros/cons for each option
- Create feature comparison tables
- Make clear recommendation with rationale
- Note trade-offs

### For Technical Investigation
- Explain findings clearly
- Support with evidence from sources
- Identify unknowns or areas needing more research
- Provide actionable next steps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prompt file created at `.chant/prompts/research-synthesis.md`
- [ ] Prompt explains synthesis process
- [ ] Prompt explains how to handle conflicts
- [ ] Prompt includes guidance for different synthesis types
- [ ] Prompt is clear and actionable
