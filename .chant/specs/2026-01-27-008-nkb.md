# Add enterprise feature documentation and examples

## Problem

The enterprise documentation in `docs/enterprise/enterprise.md` is currently marked as "largely aspirational, features not implemented" (docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md:190).

After implementing derived frontmatter, need to:
1. Update enterprise.md with actual implementation details
2. Document the `chant derive` command in CLI reference
3. Add enterprise config section to config reference
4. Update FEATURE_STATUS.md to mark feature as implemented
5. Add working examples and common patterns

## Solution

### Update docs/enterprise/enterprise.md

- Change "Status: Not Implemented" to "Status: Implemented ✅"
- Add "How It Works" section with actual behavior
- Include real examples from test suite
- Document limitations and edge cases
- Add troubleshooting section

### Update docs/reference/config.md

Add enterprise configuration section:

```markdown
## Enterprise Configuration

### Derived Fields

Configure automatic field extraction:

\`\`\`yaml
enterprise:
  derived:
    sprint:
      from: branch
      pattern: "sprint/(\\d{4}-Q\\d-W\\d)"
      validate:
        enum: [2026-Q1-W1, 2026-Q1-W2, ...]
\`\`\`

**Sources:**
- `branch`: Git branch name
- `path`: Spec file path
- `env`: Environment variable
- `git_user`: Git user.name or user.email

### Required Fields

\`\`\`yaml
enterprise:
  required:
    - team
    - jira_key
\`\`\`
```

### Update docs/reference/cli.md

Add `chant derive` command:

```markdown
### chant derive

Manually trigger field derivation for existing specs.

\`\`\`bash
chant derive <SPEC_ID>    # Derive fields for one spec
chant derive --all        # Derive for all specs
chant derive --dry-run    # Preview without modifying
\`\`\`
```

### Update docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md

Change line 190 from:
```
- `enterprise.md` - ⚠️ Largely aspirational, features not implemented
```

To:
```
- `enterprise.md` - ✅ Implemented (derived frontmatter and required fields)
```

### Add Common Patterns Section

Examples:
- Jira ticket extraction: `([A-Z]+-\\d+)`
- Sprint extraction: `sprint/(\\d{4}-Q\\d-W\\d)`
- Team from path: `teams/(\\w+)/`
- Multiple pattern examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update docs/enterprise/enterprise.md status to "Implemented ✅"
- [x] Add "How It Works" section with implementation details
- [x] Add troubleshooting section (common pattern issues, debugging tips)
- [x] Update docs/reference/config.md with enterprise section
- [x] Document all four derivation sources (branch, path, env, git_user)
- [x] Document validation rules (enum checking)
- [x] Add docs/reference/cli.md entry for `chant derive` command
- [x] Update docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md to mark as implemented
- [x] Add 3-5 real-world pattern examples
- [x] Add example showing required fields enforcement
- [x] Docs build without errors: `cd docs && mdbook build`
