# Add bidirectional links between guides and examples

## Problem

Examples and guides don't cross-reference each other:
- Only approval-workflow example links to its guide
- No guides link to their corresponding examples

## Examples → Guides (add links)

| Example README | Should link to |
|----------------|----------------|
| examples/kpi-okr-workflow/README.md | docs/guides/enterprise/kpi-okr/README.md |
| examples/tdd-workflow/README.md | docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/README.md |
| examples/research-workflow/README.md | docs/guides/research.md |
| examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/README.md | docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/index.md |

## Guides → Examples (add to See Also)

| Guide | Should link to |
|-------|----------------|
| docs/guides/approval-workflow.md | examples/approval-workflow/ |
| docs/guides/research.md | examples/research-workflow/ |
| docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/index.md | examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/ |
| docs/guides/enterprise/kpi-okr/README.md | examples/kpi-okr-workflow/ |
| docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/README.md | examples/tdd-workflow/ |

## Also fix

- Remove duplicate content in examples/README.md (lines 55-60 duplicate 65-69)
