# Release v0.2.0 with completed autonomy layer

Release version 0.2.0 of chant, marking the completion of the autonomy layer with `verify` and `replay` commands joining the existing `drift` command.

## Context

The autonomy layer enables specs to be durable specifications that:
- Detect when reality drifts from intent (`chant drift`)
- Verify acceptance criteria still hold (`chant verify`)
- Re-execute to restore intent (`chant replay`)

v0.2.0 completes this layer, making chant a tool for intent durability, not just task execution.
