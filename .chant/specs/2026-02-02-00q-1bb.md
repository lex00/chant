# Fix research-workflow test assertions to match updated spec format

## Problem

Both research-workflow assertions fail with "Research spec missing checkbox questions":
- `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/test-assertions.sh`
- `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/test-assertions.sh`

The spec format was updated during quality fixes and may have removed or changed checkbox format.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/test-assertions.sh` to check for acceptance criteria checkboxes instead of research question checkboxes
- [x] Update `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/test-assertions.sh` to check for acceptance criteria checkboxes instead of research question checkboxes
- [x] Run `./examples/test-examples.sh research-workflow` and verify all assertions pass with exit code 0
