# Refactor parallel.rs to use executor.rs shared functions

## Context

`src/cmd/work/executor.rs` has shared functions. After specs 00i and 00j, both `single.rs` and `chain.rs` will be using them. This spec does the same for `parallel.rs`.

## Bug fixes included

Parallel mode currently has missing validation that single and chain modes have:
- **Approval checking**: completely missing — specs requiring approval can start without it
- **Dependency checking**: completely missing — blocked specs can start work

These are fixed for free by routing through the executor's `validate_spec()`.

## Task

Refactor `parallel.rs` (currently ~1,445 LOC) to delegate to `executor.rs` shared functions. `parallel.rs` should only contain:
- Thread pool management and mpsc channel setup
- Per-thread spec distribution
- Result collection and reporting
- Post-merge finalization coordination

All validation, agent invocation, commit collection, finalization, and error handling should route through the same executor functions.

The executor functions must be `Send` for use in threads — adjust if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `parallel.rs` is under 300 LOC
- [ ] `parallel.rs` calls the same executor functions as single and chain modes
- [ ] Approval checking now works in parallel mode (was missing)
- [ ] Dependency checking now works in parallel mode (was missing)
- [ ] Finalization failure sets Failed (not NeedsAttention) — matching other modes
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] `cargo clippy` passes
