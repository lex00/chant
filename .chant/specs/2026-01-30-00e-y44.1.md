# Core Data Model and Types

Define the foundational data structures for the multi-dimensional scoring system.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `SpecScore` struct with fields: complexity, confidence, splittability, isolation, ac_quality, traffic_light
- [x] Define grade enums: `ComplexityGrade`, `ConfidenceGrade`, `SplittabilityGrade`, `IsolationGrade`, `ACQualityGrade` (each with variants A, B, C, D)
- [x] Define `TrafficLight` enum with variants: Ready, Review, Refine
- [x] Implement Display trait for all enums to show letter grades
- [x] Add Serialize/Deserialize derives for all types

### Edge Cases

- Optional fields: Isolation should be `Option<IsolationGrade>` (only for groups with members)
- Default values: Provide sensible defaults for SpecScore initialization

### Example Test Cases

- Creating a SpecScore with all dimensions set to A should compile
- Displaying ComplexityGrade::B should output "B"
- Serializing SpecScore to JSON should preserve all fields
