# CLAUDE.md guidance - remember there is this repo claude.md and the chant installed claude.md, they should probably be the same but the chant installed one is what users get. When using an agent as an interactive chant orchestrator the agent should always monitor logs for evidence of struggling by the executing agent. if struggling is ongoing then orchestrator should stop the agent and update the existing task into 2 phases, 1 with research and 1 with implementation. After update it should further evaluate whether or not to split the implementation off into separate spec(s)
