# Fix documentation inaccuracies for implemented features

Remove "Planned" status from features that are now implemented.

## Audit Findings

### Inaccurate (marked planned but IS implemented)

| File | Line | Issue |
|------|------|-------|
| `docs/guides/research.md` | 3 | Says "research spec type not yet implemented" - IS implemented |
| `docs/reference/cli.md` | 53-55 | Says "Split Spec (Planned)" - IS implemented |
| `docs/concepts/specs.md` | 338-340 | Says "Splitting Specs (Planned)" - IS implemented |

### Legitimate Planned (actually not implemented)

These are correctly marked as planned:
- `chant edit` - Not implemented
- `chant search` - Not implemented
- `chant verify` (drift detection) - Not implemented
- `chant daemon` - Not implemented
- `chant queue` - Not implemented
- `chant export` - Not implemented
- `chant disk` - Not implemented
- Prompt registry/marketplace - Not implemented
- `waiting` and `cancelled` spec statuses - Not implemented

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove "Status: Planned" banner from `docs/guides/research.md`
- [x] Update `docs/reference/cli.md` to show `chant split` as implemented
- [x] Update `docs/concepts/specs.md` to show `chant split` as implemented
- [x] Verify no other inaccuracies introduced
