# Integrate Scoring into chant split

Add splittability check before splitting and isolation scoring after.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Before split: Calculate splittability score and warn if Grade C or D
- [ ] Allow user to proceed with warning confirmation
- [ ] After split: Calculate isolation score for resulting group
- [ ] Display isolation percentage, shared files, and suggestions
- [ ] Format: "Split quality: {traffic_light}\n  Member isolation: {percent}% ({details})\n\nSuggestion: {text}"

### Edge Cases

- Spec with Grade D splittability should show strong warning
- Split of already-split spec (member) should be prevented
- No shared files should display "No shared files"

### Example Test Cases

- Splitting spec with Grade B splittability proceeds with no warning
- Splitting spec with Grade D splittability shows warning, requires confirmation
- After split, group with 67% isolation shows Review status

### Requires

- Calls `calculate_splittability()` from Member 5
- Calls `calculate_isolation()` from Member 6
- Calls traffic light logic from Member 8
