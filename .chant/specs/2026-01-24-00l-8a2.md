# Test replay: verify idempotent spec execution

Test that replaying an already-completed spec is idempotent and handles the "nothing to do" case gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Replay spec 00i-x54 (git hash in frontmatter) as test case
- [x] Agent detects no git changes are needed (feature already implemented)
- [x] All acceptance criteria boxes remain checked
- [x] Agent conversation is appended to spec (may have multiple Agent Output sections)
- [x] No duplicate commits created

## Test Procedure

1. Run `chant work 00i-x54 --force` to replay completed spec
2. Verify git status shows no changes after execution
3. Verify spec still has all boxes checked
4. Verify agent output section was appended

## Implementation Notes

- Use 00i-x54 as the test subject (already completed with checked boxes)
- The `--force` flag allows re-running completed specs
- Agent should recognize implementation already exists and report "nothing to do"
- This validates the agent prompt instructs proper idempotent behavior
