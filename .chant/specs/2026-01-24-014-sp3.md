# Document log streaming behavior during chant work

The log file is streamed in real-time during `chant work` execution, enabling `chant log -f` to work while work is running. This is not clearly documented.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update the Logs section in docs/reference/cli.md
- [x] Explain that logs are streamed in real-time (not buffered until end)
- [x] Add example workflow showing two terminals
- [x] Mention the log file header is written before agent starts

## Content to Add

```markdown
### Real-time Log Streaming

Logs are streamed to the log file in real-time as the agent produces output, not buffered until completion. This enables monitoring spec execution as it happens:

**Terminal 1:**
\`\`\`bash
chant work 001    # Agent runs, streams to stdout AND log file
\`\`\`

**Terminal 2 (simultaneously):**
\`\`\`bash
chant log 001 -f  # See output in real-time as agent works
\`\`\`

The log file header (spec ID, timestamp, prompt name) is written before the agent starts, so `chant log -f` will begin showing content immediately.
