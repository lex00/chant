# Traffic Light Logic and Suggestions

Combine dimension grades into traffic light status and generate actionable suggestions.

### Inherited Context

- Traffic light determines readiness: Ready (green), Review (yellow), Refine (red)
- Suggestions should be specific and actionable

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement `determine_status(score: &SpecScore) -> TrafficLight` function
- [ ] Ready: Complexity ≤ B AND Confidence ≥ B AND AC Quality ≥ B
- [ ] Refine: Any dimension is D OR Confidence is D
- [ ] Review: All other cases (any dimension is C)
- [ ] Implement `generate_suggestions(score: &SpecScore) -> Vec<String>` function
- [ ] Suggestions based on failing dimensions (e.g., "Add more specific acceptance criteria" for low AC quality)

### Edge Cases

- If multiple dimensions fail, return multiple suggestions
- Isolation grade (optional) should not affect traffic light but can add suggestions
- Suggestions should be unique (no duplicates)

### Example Test Cases

- All grades A → Ready, no suggestions
- Complexity B, Confidence C, AC A → Review, suggestion: "Improve spec structure (add more bullets)"
- Complexity D → Refine, suggestion: "Reduce criteria count or split spec"

### Requires

- Uses `SpecScore` and all grade types from Member 1
- Uses scoring functions from Members 2-7

### Provides

- `determine_status(score: &SpecScore) -> TrafficLight` - Returns traffic light status
- `generate_suggestions(score: &SpecScore) -> Vec<String>` - Returns actionable feedback
