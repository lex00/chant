# Create merge-conflict.md prompt template for agent-assisted conflict resolution

## Problem

The `chant merge --rebase --auto` feature invokes an agent to resolve conflicts, but the prompt template didn't exist. The code had a fallback inline prompt, but a proper template provides better guidance.

## Solution

Created `.chant/prompts/merge-conflict.md` with:
- Template variables: `{{branch_name}}`, `{{target_branch}}`, `{{conflicting_files}}`, `{{conflict_diff}}`
- Step-by-step conflict resolution instructions
- Common patterns for spec frontmatter and code conflicts
- Important notes about rebase workflow (no commit, just stage and continue)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] merge-conflict.md prompt template created
- [x] Template uses correct variable names matching the code
- [x] Instructions cover common conflict patterns
- [x] Prompt guides agent through proper rebase workflow
