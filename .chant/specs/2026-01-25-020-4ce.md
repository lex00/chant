# Fix installed CLAUDE.md template - remove justfile references

## Problem

When users run `chant init`, the installed CLAUDE.md template references `justfile` commands like:
- `just chant add`
- `just build`
- `just test`

But customers only have the `chant` CLI installed - they don't have the justfile. That's a development tool for chant developers only.

## Solution

Update the CLAUDE.md template in `src/templates.rs` to:
1. Remove all `just` command references
2. Use direct `chant` commands instead (e.g., `chant add`, `chant work`)
3. For build/test, reference standard cargo commands or remove if not applicable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Template uses `chant` commands not `just chant`
- [x] No justfile references in installed CLAUDE.md
- [x] Instructions make sense for end users
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code linted
