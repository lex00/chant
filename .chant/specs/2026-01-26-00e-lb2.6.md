# Update spec frontmatter with verification results

After verification completes, update the spec's frontmatter with `last_verified` timestamp, `verification_status` (passed/failed/partial), and `verification_failures` array. Write the updated spec back to disk.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `last_verified` set to current UTC timestamp after verification
- [x] `verification_status` set to "passed", "failed", or "partial" based on results
- [x] `verification_failures` populated with failure reasons from FAIL criteria
- [x] Updated spec written to disk with frontmatter changes
- [x] `just test` includes test case for frontmatter updates

### Edge Cases

- Verification skipped (dry-run): Frontmatter should not be modified
- All criteria PASS: `verification_failures` should be None or empty array
- Mix of PASS/FAIL/SKIP: Status should be "partial", failures should list FAIL reasons only
- File write fails (permissions): Should display clear error message

### Example Test Cases

For this feature, verify:
- Spec with all PASS has status "passed" and no failures
- Spec with any FAIL has status "failed" and failures listed
- Spec with mix has status "partial" and only FAIL reasons listed
- Timestamp in frontmatter is valid ISO 8601 format
