# Change spec sorting to use file modification time

## Problem

Current sorting parses spec IDs and compares base36 sequences. This is complex and tightly coupled to the ID format.

## Solution

Sort by file modification time (mtime) instead. This is:
- Simpler - no ID parsing needed
- More intuitive - reflects when spec was last touched
- Platform-independent - mtime works everywhere (unlike ctime)

## Implementation

In `src/cmd/spec/list.rs`, replace the current sort with:

```rust
specs.sort_by(|a, b| {
    let a_path = specs_dir.join(format!("{}.md", a.id));
    let b_path = specs_dir.join(format!("{}.md", b.id));
    let a_time = std::fs::metadata(&a_path).and_then(|m| m.modified()).ok();
    let b_time = std::fs::metadata(&b_path).and_then(|m| m.modified()).ok();
    a_time.cmp(&b_time)
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sort specs by file modification time (oldest first)
- [ ] Remove or simplify the base36 parsing from compare_spec_ids
- [ ] Verify `chant list` shows specs in correct chronological order
