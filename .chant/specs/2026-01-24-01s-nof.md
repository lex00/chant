# Fix terminology - rename subtasks to member specs in split command

## Problem

The split command uses "subtask" terminology but chant doesn't have tasks - it has specs. The split command creates a **spec group** with **member specs**, not "subtasks".

Current confusing terms:
- "subtask" → should be "member spec" or just "member"
- "Split into subtasks" → should be "Split into spec group"
- `Subtask` struct → should be `MemberSpec` or similar

## Terminology to Use

| Old Term | New Term |
|----------|----------|
| subtask | member (spec) |
| driver spec | group driver |
| split into subtasks | split into members |
| Subtask struct | MemberSpec |

## Affected Areas

1. **Code** (`src/main.rs`):
   - `Subtask` struct → `MemberSpec`
   - `parse_subtasks_from_agent_output()` → `parse_member_specs_from_output()`
   - Variable names like `subtasks` → `members`
   - Print messages referencing "subtasks"

2. **Split Prompt** (`.chant/prompts/split.md`):
   - "subtasks" → "member specs"
   - Output format header: `## Subtask N:` → `## Member N:`

3. **CLI Output**:
   - "Creating 5 subtasks" → "Creating 5 member specs"
   - "Subtasks:" listing → "Members:"

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rename `Subtask` struct to `MemberSpec`
- [ ] Rename `parse_subtasks_from_agent_output()` to `parse_member_specs_from_output()`
- [ ] Update all variable names from `subtask(s)` to `member(s)`
- [ ] Update split.md prompt to use "member" terminology
- [ ] Update CLI output messages
- [ ] Update test names and assertions
- [ ] Ensure split command still works end-to-end
- [ ] All tests pass
