# Fix documentation accuracy issues from audit

## Problem

Documentation audit found 20 discrepancies where docs describe commands/flags/features that don't exist or differ from implementation. This creates confusion and broken workflows for users.

## Solution

### 1. Move to Planning Section (Not Yet Implemented)

Create `docs/planning/` directory for features under consideration:

- **Git hooks automation** - consolidate git.md hook examples, mark as planned
- **`chant lint --files`** - potentially useful, needs design
- **`chant report`** - team analytics, needs design
- **`decisions:` frontmatter field** - needs behavior investigation
- **Spec templates system** - needs design decision on templating approach

### 2. Remove from Docs (Covered by Existing Commands)

- **`chant deps`** → Use `chant show` (already shows depends_on)
- **`chant history`** → Use `chant show` (shows spec timeline)
- **`chant failures`** → Use `chant list --status failed`
- **`chant split --then`** → Just use two commands: `chant split 001 && chant work ...`
- **Cleanup subcommands** (`clones`, `branches`) → Auto cleanup is sufficient

### 3. Fix `chant show` Behavior

**Current**: Shows full markdown body by default
**New**: Show frontmatter summary by default

```bash
$ chant show 001
ID: 2026-01-29-001-bcb
Title: Fix documentation accuracy issues
Type: documentation
Status: pending
Target Files:
  - docs/reference/git.md
  - docs/concepts/deps.md
```

Add `--body` flag to show full content:
```bash
$ chant show 001 --body
# (full markdown content)
```

### 4. Critical Fixes in docs/reference/git.md

Remove non-existent commands/flags:
- Line 117: `chant update "$spec_id" --commit` (command doesn't exist)
- Line 131: `chant show "$spec_id" --format status` (flag doesn't exist)
- Line 191: `chant init --install-merge-driver` (flag doesn't exist)

Fix git hooks examples to use actual commands or mark as aspirational.
