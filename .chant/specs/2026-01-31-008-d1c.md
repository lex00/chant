# Fix failing test_load_with_branch_resolution_in_progress_with_branch integration test

## Findings

The test `test_load_with_branch_resolution_in_progress_with_branch` is passing consistently.
Investigation revealed that this test was already fixed by commit c4427c7
(chant(2026-01-31-005-vvj): Fix branch resolution reading stale branch after merge),
which was merged before this spec's branch was created.

Verified the test passes consistently across 5 runs and the full test suite passes.
