# Create research workflow example with academic and developer paths

## Context

The research.md guide shows two main patterns:
1. **Synthesis** (academic) - synthesizing multiple sources into findings
2. **Data Analysis** (developer) - analyzing data/code to generate findings

Create an example that demonstrates both paths.

## Structure

```
examples/research-workflow/
├── README.md
├── academic-path/
│   ├── .chant/
│   │   └── specs/
│   │       └── 001-lit-review.md      # Synthesis spec
│   └── papers/
│       ├── source1.md                  # Simulated paper excerpts
│       └── source2.md
└── developer-path/
    ├── .chant/
    │   └── specs/
    │       └── 001-tech-debt.md       # Analysis spec
    └── src/
        └── sample-code/                # Code to analyze
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `examples/research-workflow/README.md` exists with overview of both paths
- [x] `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/specs/001-lit-review.md` uses `informed_by:` and `target_files:`
- [x] `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/papers/` contains 2+ simulated source documents
- [x] `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/specs/001-tech-debt.md` uses `informed_by:` with glob pattern
- [x] `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/src/` contains sample code with TODOs/complexity
- [x] Both specs show research questions as checkboxes
- [x] Both specs demonstrate proper acceptance criteria format
- [x] `examples/README.md` updated to include research-workflow entry
