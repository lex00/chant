# Documentation gap hunt: cross-reference specs with docs

Systematically review all completed specs to identify implemented features, then cross-reference with documentation to find undocumented or poorly documented features. Create new specs to address each gap.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] List all completed specs and their implemented features
- [x] Review each doc file in docs/ for coverage of implemented features
- [x] Identify features that are undocumented or have incomplete examples
- [x] Create a new spec for each documentation gap found
- [x] Prioritize gaps by user impact (CLI commands > config > internal)

## Research Process

1. **Inventory implemented features** from specs:
   - `chant list` to see all completed specs
   - Extract feature summaries from each spec

2. **Review documentation coverage**:
   - docs/reference/cli.md - CLI commands
   - docs/reference/config.md - Configuration options
   - docs/reference/mcp.md - MCP server tools
   - docs/concepts/specs.md - Spec features
   - docs/concepts/prompts.md - Prompt templates

3. **Create gap specs** for each missing item:
   - Use `chant add "Document <feature>"` for each gap
   - Include examples in the spec body

## Recent Features to Check

From recent spec history:
- 00u: --parallel flag
- 00v: Agent logging to .chant/logs/
- 00w: Logging tests
- 00x: chant log command
- 00y: just chant recipe
- 00z: Model tagging in frontmatter
- 010: Log streaming during work
- 011: Clippy warning fixes

## Output

List of new documentation specs created.

## Research Findings

### Completed Specs Reviewed (37 total)

| Spec | Feature | Documented? |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 001-cxn | `--branch` flag | ✅ Yes (cli.md) |
| 002-u0g | `--pr` flag | ✅ Yes (cli.md) |
| 003-rvw | branch/pr defaults | ✅ Yes (config.md) |
| 004-007 | MCP server tools | ✅ Yes (mcp.md) |
| 007-hzq | Global config | ✅ Yes (config.md) |
| 008-19q | `depends_on` field | ✅ Yes (specs.md) |
| 009-0mq | `--label` filter | ✅ Yes (cli.md) |
| 00a-f6z | `chant status` | ✅ Yes (cli.md) |
| 00b-t2e | `chant ready` | ✅ Yes (cli.md) |
| 00c-u3c | `chant lint` | ✅ Yes (schema.md) |
| 00u-5kn | `--parallel` flag | ✅ Yes (cli.md) |
| 00v-6zj | Agent logs | ✅ Yes (lifecycle.md) |
| 00x-1fz | `chant log` | ✅ Yes (cli.md) |
| 00y-ayy | `just chant` recipe | ⚠️ Internal dev tool |
| 00z-87n | `model` field | ❌ Incomplete |
| 010-zle | Log streaming | ❌ Undocumented |
| 011-sxz | Clippy fixes | ⚠️ Internal maintenance |

### Documentation Gaps Identified

1. **Log streaming during work** (HIGH priority - CLI)
   - `chant log -f` works in real-time during execution
   - Not mentioned in cli.md

2. **Model field in frontmatter** (MEDIUM priority - config)
   - Appears in completed specs but no explanation
   - Users don't know how it's detected or why it matters

### New Specs Created

| Spec ID | Title | Priority |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 013-e5s | Document model field in spec frontmatter | MEDIUM |
| 014-sp3 | Document log streaming behavior during chant work | HIGH |

## Agent Output

2026-01-24T13:56:19Z

```
The spec is complete. Here's a summary of the work:

## Summary

I systematically reviewed all 37 completed specs and cross-referenced them with the documentation to identify gaps.

### Findings

**Well Documented (35 features):**
- All CLI commands (`--branch`, `--pr`, `--parallel`, `--label`, `--force`, etc.)
- MCP server tools (list, get, update)
- Configuration options (global config, defaults, git provider)
- Spec features (depends_on, acceptance criteria validation, agent output)
- Log command and lifecycle

**Documentation Gaps Found (2):**

| Priority | Spec ID | Gap |
|----------|---------|-----|
| HIGH (CLI) | 014-sp3 | Log streaming during `chant work` - users don't know `chant log -f` works in real-time |
| MEDIUM (config) | 013-e5s | Model field in frontmatter - no explanation of what it is or how it's detected |

### New Specs Created

1. **2026-01-24-013-e5s**: Document model field in spec frontmatter
2. **2026-01-24-014-sp3**: Document log streaming behavior during chant work

Both specs include detailed acceptance criteria and example content to add.```
