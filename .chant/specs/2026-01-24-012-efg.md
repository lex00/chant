# Documentation gap hunt: cross-reference specs with docs

Systematically review all completed specs to identify implemented features, then cross-reference with documentation to find undocumented or poorly documented features. Create new specs to address each gap.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] List all completed specs and their implemented features
- [ ] Review each doc file in docs/ for coverage of implemented features
- [ ] Identify features that are undocumented or have incomplete examples
- [ ] Create a new spec for each documentation gap found
- [ ] Prioritize gaps by user impact (CLI commands > config > internal)

## Research Process

1. **Inventory implemented features** from specs:
   - `chant list` to see all completed specs
   - Extract feature summaries from each spec

2. **Review documentation coverage**:
   - docs/reference/cli.md - CLI commands
   - docs/reference/config.md - Configuration options
   - docs/reference/mcp.md - MCP server tools
   - docs/concepts/specs.md - Spec features
   - docs/concepts/prompts.md - Prompt templates

3. **Create gap specs** for each missing item:
   - Use `chant add "Document <feature>"` for each gap
   - Include examples in the spec body
