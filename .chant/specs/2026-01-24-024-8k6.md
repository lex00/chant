# Change stealth terminology to silent for better UX

## Problem

The term "stealth" sounds nefarious/sneaky. Better to use "silent" which sounds useful and professional.

## Changes

| Old Term | New Term |
|----------|----------|
| stealth | silent |
| --stealth | --silent |
| stealth mode | silent mode |
| STEALTH | SILENT |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Find all occurrences of "stealth" in codebase
- [ ] Rename to "silent" (flags, variables, config, docs)
- [ ] Update CLI help text
- [ ] Update any documentation
- [ ] All tests pass
