# Change stealth terminology to silent for better UX

## Problem

The term "stealth" sounds nefarious/sneaky. Better to use "silent" which sounds useful and professional.

## Changes

| Old Term | New Term |
|----------|----------|
| stealth | silent |
| --stealth | --silent |
| stealth mode | silent mode |
| STEALTH | SILENT |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Find all occurrences of "stealth" in codebase
- [x] Rename to "silent" (flags, variables, config, docs)
- [x] Update CLI help text
- [x] Update any documentation
- [x] All tests pass
