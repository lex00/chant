# Add staggered agent launch in parallel mode - add configurable delay between spawning each agent to avoid API rate limiting. Default 1-2 seconds between launches. Add parallel.stagger_delay_ms config option.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Added `parallel.stagger_delay_ms` configuration option to `ParallelConfig` struct
- [x] Default value set to 1000 milliseconds (1 second) for staggered agent launches
- [x] Implemented delay logic between agent spawns in `cmd_work_parallel()` function
- [x] All tests pass without failures
- [x] Code formatted with `cargo fmt` and validated with `cargo clippy`
- [x] Configuration is optional and respects user-provided values
