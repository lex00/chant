# Reduce clone() calls in cmd/spec/lint.rs

Refactor lint.rs validation functions to accept references instead of owned values, reducing clone() count by 50%+.

### Inherited Context

- Each task must leave code in a compilable state
- No functionality changes allowed
- Only clone when ownership transfer is required

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Change validation functions to accept &Spec instead of Spec
- [ ] Use string slices (&str) instead of cloning Strings
- [ ] Use references in lint results collection
- [ ] clone() count reduced by at least 50% (from 28 to ≤14)
- [ ] cargo test and cargo clippy pass

### Edge Cases

- Functions that store Spec data in returned structures may need clones
- Error messages that capture String values may need clones
- Iterator chains that move values may require adjustments

### Example Test Cases

- All existing lint tests pass unchanged
- clippy::unnecessary_clone warnings eliminated
- No new lifetime compilation errors
