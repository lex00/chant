# Create approval workflow example in examples folder

## Output

## Goal

Create a standalone working example demonstrating the approval workflow from `docs/guides/approval-workflow.md`.

## Example Structure

```
examples/approval-workflow/
├── README.md              # Overview and how to run
├── .chant/
│   ├── config.md          # Config with approval settings
│   ├── specs/
│   │   ├── 001-risky-refactor.md    # Spec requiring approval (pending)
│   │   ├── 002-approved-feature.md  # Spec that was approved
│   │   └── 003-rejected-change.md   # Spec that was rejected
│   └── prompts/
│       └── standard.md    # Basic prompt
└── src/                   # Minimal sample code (optional)
```

## What to Demonstrate

1. **Spec requiring approval** - `--needs-approval` flag, pending state
2. **Approved spec** - Shows approval frontmatter and discussion section
3. **Rejected spec** - Shows rejection with reason and discussion
4. **Config** - `approval.require_approval_for_agent_work: true`

## README Content

Should explain:
- What the example demonstrates
- How to explore the specs (`chant show`, `chant list --approval`)
- How to reproduce the workflow
- Link back to full guide

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `examples/approval-workflow/README.md` exists with clear explanation
- [x] `examples/approval-workflow/.chant/config.md` has approval config
- [x] `examples/approval-workflow/.chant/specs/` contains 3 example specs showing pending/approved/rejected states
- [x] Each spec has realistic content (not placeholder text)
- [x] Approval Discussion sections show example entries
- [x] `examples/README.md` updated to list the new example
