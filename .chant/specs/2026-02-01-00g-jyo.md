# Document watch command

The `watch` command exists in src/main.rs but is completely undocumented in `docs/reference/cli.md`.

## Tasks

1. Read watch command definition in src/main.rs (around line 610-620)
2. Document all flags: `--once`, `--dry-run`, `--poll-interval`
3. Add section to `docs/reference/cli.md` following existing command format
4. Add usage examples
5. Add to FEATURE_STATUS.md if missing

## Reference (from main.rs)

```
Watch {
    /// Exit after first finalization
    #[arg(long)]
    once: bool,
    /// Show what would be done without doing it
    #[arg(long)]
    dry_run: bool,
    /// Poll interval in seconds
    #[arg(long, default_value = "5")]
    poll_interval: u64,
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Watch command section added to docs/reference/cli.md
- [ ] All flags documented with descriptions
- [ ] At least 2 usage examples provided
- [ ] Added to FEATURE_STATUS.md command list
