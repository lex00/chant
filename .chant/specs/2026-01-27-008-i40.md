# Clarify workflow: edit spec to add acceptance criteria before working

## Problem

Agents create specs with `chant add` and immediately work them without adding acceptance criteria first. This results in:
- Specs with no clear definition of done
- Agent guessing what "complete" means
- Work that doesn't match user expectations

## Solution

Add clear workflow documentation:

```
1. chant add "description"     # Creates minimal spec
2. Edit the spec file          # Add acceptance criteria, details
3. chant work <spec-id>        # Now work it
```

Emphasize that `chant add` only creates a skeleton - the spec MUST be edited to add:
- Detailed problem description
- Solution approach
- Acceptance criteria checklist

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] templates/agent-claude.md documents the 3-step workflow
- [ ] CLAUDE.md has same workflow (using `just chant`)
- [ ] Warns against immediately working a freshly-created spec
- [ ] `just lint` passes
