# Clarify in agent docs: never use bash background processes for parallel spec work

## Problem

Agents sometimes try to parallelize spec work by backgrounding bash processes:
```bash
chant work spec-1 &
chant work spec-2 &
wait
```

This is wrong because:
- Chant has built-in parallel execution via `chant work --parallel`
- Background processes lose output visibility
- No proper agent rotation or stagger delays
- Confuses the orchestrator about what's running

## Solution

Add explicit "What NOT to do" section in agent docs warning against:
- Backgrounding chant commands with `&`
- Using shell job control for parallelism
- Any manual parallelization of spec execution

Direct agents to use `chant work --parallel` or `chant work spec1 spec2 spec3` instead.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] templates/agent-claude.md has explicit warning against bash backgrounding
- [x] CLAUDE.md has same warning (using `just chant`)
- [x] Shows correct alternative: `chant work --parallel` or multiple spec IDs
- [x] `just lint` passes
