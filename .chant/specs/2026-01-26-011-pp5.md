# Audit and update documentation with recent features

## Overview

Several new features have been added recently that need documentation:

### New Commands
- `chant drift` - Detect stale inputs in documentation/research specs
- `chant resume` - Retry failed specs (reset to pending, optionally re-execute)
- `chant export` - Export specs to JSON, CSV, or Markdown with filtering
- `chant disk` - Show disk usage of chant artifacts

### Enhanced Commands
- `chant merge --rebase` - Rebase branches before ff-merge (for parallel branches)
- `chant merge --auto` - Agent-assisted conflict resolution
- `chant work <id1> <id2> ...` - Multi-ID support for selective parallel execution

### Infrastructure
- Branch prefix now uses config consistently (no more hardcoded "spec/")
- merge-conflict.md prompt template for conflict resolution
- Unified ID matching across all commands

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] docs/commands.md updated with new commands (drift, resume, export, disk)
- [ ] docs/commands.md updated with new merge flags (--rebase, --auto)
- [ ] docs/parallel.md updated with multi-ID work support
- [ ] docs/configuration.md updated if any new config options
- [ ] docs/prompts.md updated with merge-conflict.md template
- [ ] README.md updated if needed for new features
- [ ] Check all code examples are current
