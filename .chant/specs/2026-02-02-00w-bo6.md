# Evaluate recovery.md and ecosystem.md guides for expansion or removal

## Goal

Determine whether recovery.md and ecosystem.md should become full multi-file guides with examples, or be removed/consolidated.

## Research Questions

- [ ] What does recovery.md currently cover? Is it substantial enough for an example?
- [ ] What does ecosystem.md currently cover? Is it substantial enough for an example?
- [ ] Are these guides referenced elsewhere in the documentation?
- [ ] Would users benefit from working examples of these workflows?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document findings in `.chant/research/guide-evaluation.md`
- [ ] Provide recommendation: expand, consolidate, or remove each guide
- [ ] If recommending removal, identify what content should be preserved elsewhere
