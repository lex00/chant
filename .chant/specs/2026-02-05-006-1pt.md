# Add progress streaming to chant work - show real-time agent output during execution instead of being silent until completion

## Context

Currently, `chant work` streams agent output in real-time through the model provider's callback mechanism. This feature verifies that streaming is working correctly across all providers and code paths.

## Implementation

The streaming infrastructure is already in place:
- `ClaudeCliProvider` streams via stdout line-by-line (provider.rs:115-126)
- `OllamaProvider` and `OpenaiProvider` stream via API callbacks (provider.rs:307-335)
- All providers call the callback which prints immediately (agent.rs:281-288)
- `invoke_agent_with_command_override` streams via stdout (agent.rs:88-104)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Verify `ClaudeCliProvider` streams output line-by-line in real-time
- [x] Verify `invoke_agent_with_command_override` streams output correctly
- [x] Code is formatted with `cargo fmt`
- [x] Code passes `cargo clippy`
- [x] Streaming works for single spec execution path
