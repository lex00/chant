# Configurable PR provider (fix bootstrap gap)

Bootstrap hardcoded GitHub as the PR provider. This should be configurable to support GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `git.provider` config option (github, gitlab, bitbucket)
- [x] Abstract PR creation behind a provider trait/interface
- [x] Implement GitHub provider (current behavior)
- [x] Default to github if not specified
- [x] Document provider configuration in reference docs

## Implementation Notes

- Current code hardcodes `gh pr create` in `create_pull_request` function
- Provider config should go in `.chant/config.md` under `git:` section
- Future: GitLab would use `glab`, Bitbucket would use their CLI
- Consider detecting provider from remote URL as fallback

## Context

This was missed during bootstrap Phase 1 which should have included provider abstraction per the roadmap's "MCP + Providers" design.
