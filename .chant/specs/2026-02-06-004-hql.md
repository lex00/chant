# Add monorepo documentation guide

## Context
Chant supports multiple `.chant/` directories in a monorepo (each subdirectory = independent project), but this isn't documented.

## Changes Required

### New file: `docs/guides/monorepo.md`

Cover:
- Each subdirectory with `.chant/` = independent chant project
- How MCP discovery walks up to nearest `.chant/` (already works)
- Set unique `project.name` in each config (used for worktree namespacing to avoid `/tmp` collisions)
- Set `defaults.branch_prefix` to e.g. `chant/frontend/` for branch isolation between projects
- MCP: each project needs its own MCP server instance (different `--cwd` or working directory)
- `chant list --global` for cross-project visibility
- Example directory structure and config snippets

### Update: `docs/reference/config.md`

- Add documentation for `project.name` field explaining its role in worktree namespacing
- Add note about `defaults.branch_prefix` for multi-project isolation
- Cross-reference the monorepo guide

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `docs/guides/monorepo.md` exists with clear setup instructions
- [x] Covers project.name for worktree namespacing
- [x] Covers branch_prefix for branch isolation
- [x] Covers MCP server per-project setup
- [x] Covers global listing across projects
- [x] `docs/reference/config.md` updated with project.name and branch_prefix notes
- [x] Documentation is accurate and matches the implementation from spec 2026-02-06-002-826
