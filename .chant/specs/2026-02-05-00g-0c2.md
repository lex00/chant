# Ensure `chant init` creates `.chant/logs/` and `.chant/processes/` directories. Currently these can be missing, breaking log and process tracking. Also investigate if `init --force-overwrite` or other commands accidentally delete them.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `chant init` creates `.chant/logs/` directory
- [x] `chant init` creates `.chant/processes/` directory
- [x] `chant init --force-overwrite` creates `.chant/logs/` directory
- [x] `chant init --force-overwrite` creates `.chant/processes/` directory
- [x] Code formatted with `cargo fmt`
- [x] No clippy warnings
