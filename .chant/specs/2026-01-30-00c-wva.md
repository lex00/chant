# Create Cursor Quick Start guide for new users

Create a human-readable quick start guide for users new to both Cursor and chant. This complements the `.cursorrules` file (which is for Cursor's AI).

## Target Audience

Someone who:
- Has Cursor installed (or needs to install it)
- Wants to use chant for spec-driven development
- Is new to both tools

## Sections to Include

1. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
2. **Install chant** - How to install the CLI
3. **Initialize your project** - `chant init --agent cursor`
4. **Verify MCP is working** - How to confirm Cursor sees the chant tools
5. **Your first spec** - Create, work, and complete a simple spec
6. **Workflow overview** - Quick reference for daily use

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `docs/guides/cursor-quickstart.md`
- [x] Document chant installation (cargo install, homebrew, or binary)
- [x] Document `chant init --agent cursor` and what it creates
- [x] Explain how to verify MCP is configured (restart Cursor, check tools available)
- [x] Walk through creating and working a first spec
- [x] Include troubleshooting section (MCP not loading, common errors)
- [x] Link to `.cursorrules` as the technical reference for Cursor's AI behavior
