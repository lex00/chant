# Add Ready variant to SpecStatus enum

## Problem

CLAUDE.md documents `status: ready` as a valid spec status, but the `SpecStatus` enum in `src/spec.rs` doesn't have a `Ready` variant. This causes specs with `status: ready` to fail parsing with "Failed to parse spec frontmatter".

Current enum variants: `Pending`, `InProgress`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `NeedsAttention`

## Solution

Add `Ready` variant to the `SpecStatus` enum in `src/spec.rs`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `Ready` variant added to `SpecStatus` enum
- [x] Specs with `status: ready` parse correctly
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code linted
