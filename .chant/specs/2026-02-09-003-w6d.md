# E2E test: verify linter no longer blocks work on low-quality specs
This is a deliberately prose-heavy spec with no bullet points to test that the linter fix works. The confidence scorer should give this a low grade but chant_work_start should NOT block.

The old behavior would return isError: true and prevent work from starting. The new behavior should return success with an advisory quality_warning field.

This spec can be cancelled after testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] This spec exists
- [ ] Work can be started on it without skip_criteria
