# Add test-docs.sh script to validate documentation links

## Goal

Create a script that validates all markdown links in docs/ and examples/ are not broken.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `scripts/test-docs.sh` that scans markdown files for links
- [x] Script checks that relative links point to existing files
- [x] Script reports broken links with file:line references
- [x] Script exits 0 if all links valid, 1 if any broken
- [x] All current docs pass the link check (fix any broken links found)
