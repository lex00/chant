# Add test-docs.sh script to validate documentation links

## Goal

Create a script that validates all markdown links in docs/ and examples/ are not broken.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `scripts/test-docs.sh` that scans markdown files for links
- [ ] Script checks that relative links point to existing files
- [ ] Script reports broken links with file:line references
- [ ] Script exits 0 if all links valid, 1 if any broken
- [ ] All current docs pass the link check (fix any broken links found)
