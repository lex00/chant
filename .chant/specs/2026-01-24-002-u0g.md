# Add --pr flag to create pull requests via gh CLI

When executing `chant work`, add a `--pr` flag that creates a GitHub pull request after the spec completes successfully.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `--pr` flag to the `work` command
- [ ] When `--pr` is passed and spec completes successfully, create a PR using `gh pr create`
- [ ] The PR title should be the spec title
- [ ] The PR body should include the spec description
- [ ] Update the spec frontmatter with `pr: <pr-url>` after creating the PR
- [ ] If `--pr` is used, `--branch` should be implied (can't create PR without a branch)

## Implementation Notes

- Use `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."` to create PRs
- The branch must be pushed to remote before creating PR
- Use `git push -u origin <branch>` to push the branch
- Capture the PR URL from gh output
