# Docs: Ensure OSS workflow guide aligns with example source

## Problem
The OSS workflow guide phases should match the actual example source in examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/

## Tasks
1. Read example source files in examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/
2. Compare with guide content in docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/
3. Update guide to match example naming, structure, outputs
4. Ensure spec IDs, informed_by chains, and outputs are consistent
5. Test: Following the guide should produce specs matching the example

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Guide phases match example source structure
- [x] Spec templates in guide match example specs
- [x] informed_by references are consistent
- [x] Output examples in guide match example source outputs

## Output



## Dependencies
This spec should run AFTER the file cleanup spec (01b-h9e) completes, since it needs to verify alignment after duplicates are removed.
