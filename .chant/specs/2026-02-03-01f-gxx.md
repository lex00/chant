# Fix: MCP chant_work_start not marking specs as in_progress

## Problem
When using `chant_work_start` MCP tool, specs are not being marked as `in_progress` status, unlike the CLI `chant work` command.

## Investigation
- Check src/mcp/handlers.rs for work_start handler
- Compare with src/cmd/work.rs behavior
- Ensure status update happens before spawning agent

## Solution
The MCP handler should:
1. Set spec status to `in_progress` before starting work
2. Match CLI behavior exactly
3. Return proper status in response

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MCP chant_work_start sets spec status to in_progress
- [ ] Status change happens before agent spawn
- [ ] Behavior matches CLI `chant work` command
- [ ] Add test for status update
