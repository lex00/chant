# Release v0.5.0 with approval system and breaking changes

## Problem

This session implemented a complete approval workflow system and made significant documentation improvements. These changes warrant a new minor version release (v0.5.0) due to:
- Major new feature: Approval system
- Breaking change: Removal of GitHub PR integration
- Comprehensive documentation updates

The last release was v0.4.0 (released 2026-01-28), which added refresh, merge improvements, and worktree finalization.

## Solution

Release v0.5.0 with a comprehensive changelog documenting:
1. **New approval system features** (5 specs implemented)
2. **Breaking changes** (GitHub PR removal)
3. **Documentation improvements** (roadmap, links, CLAUDE.md, approval docs)
4. Version bump in Cargo.toml
5. Git tag creation
6. Release commit

## Changelog Content

### Added
- **Approval system** - Human-in-the-loop governance for spec execution
  - `chant approve <spec-id> --by <name>` - Approve specs with committer validation
  - `chant reject <spec-id> --by <name> --reason <text>` - Reject specs with reason
  - `chant add --needs-approval` - Create specs requiring approval
  - `chant work --skip-approval` - Emergency override for approval gate
  - `approval:` frontmatter schema (`required`, `status`, `by`, `at`)
  - "## Approval Discussion" section in spec body for threaded conversation
  - Configurable rejection handling via `approval.rejection_action` (manual/dependency/group)

- **Activity tracking** - Git-based activity feed for all spec operations
  - `chant activity [--by] [--since] [--spec]` - Show chronological activity
  - Detects: CREATED, APPROVED, REJECTED, WORKED, COMPLETED events
  - Duration parsing: "2h", "1d", "1w", "1m"
  - Colored output with timestamp, author, action, spec-id

- **Enhanced list filtering** - Powerful filtering and visual indicators
  - `--approval <status>` - Filter by approval status (pending/approved/rejected)
  - `--created-by <name>` - Filter by spec creator (from git log)
  - `--activity-since <duration>` - Filter by recent activity
  - `--mentions <name>` - Filter specs mentioning person in approval discussion
  - `--count` - Show only count of matching specs
  - Visual indicators: `👤 name` (creator), `↩ 2h` (activity), `💬 3` (comments), `✓ name` (approved by)
  - Status markers: `[needs approval]`, `[rejected]`, `[approved]`

- **Rejection action handlers** - Configurable workflows for rejected specs
  - Manual mode: Leave rejected, user handles it
  - Dependency mode: Create fix spec, original becomes blocked
  - Group mode: Convert to driver with numbered member specs
  - `members:` frontmatter field for driver/group specs

- **Documentation** - Comprehensive approval system documentation
  - New guide: `docs/guides/approval-workflow.md` with examples
  - Full CLI reference coverage for all new commands
  - Config reference with approval settings
  - Updated lifecycle diagram with approval gate
  - Examples for team development workflows

### Changed
- **Roadmap restructured** - Now forward-looking only
  - Removed 492 lines of historical/implemented feature content
  - Roadmap focuses on planned features (v0.4.0, v0.5.0, v1.0.0)
  - Updated 11 cross-references to remove phase mentions

- **CLAUDE.md improvements** - Better orchestrator guidance
  - Added "Orchestrator Pattern - Monitoring Agent Execution" section
  - Documents struggling agent indicators and stop-and-split workflow
  - Synced repo and template versions for consistency

### Removed (Breaking)
- **GitHub PR integration** - Completely removed
  - Removed `--pr` flag from `chant work` and `chant replay`
  - Deleted PR creation for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
  - Removed `GitConfig`, `GitProvider`, `pr` field from config and frontmatter
  - Removed 774 lines of PR-related code
  - Documentation updated to emphasize spec-as-PR model
  - **Migration**: Specs are already the PR primitive. Use `chant work --branch` for feature branches without external PR creation.

### Fixed
- **mdBook links** - Fixed broken GitHub icon and internal links
  - Fixed GitHub repository URL (`chant-dev/chant` → `lex00/chant`)
  - Fixed 8 broken internal documentation links
  - Added `docs-check-links` justfile recipe for maintenance

### Documentation
- Complete approval workflow guide with team/solo examples
- CLI reference: All new commands and flags documented
