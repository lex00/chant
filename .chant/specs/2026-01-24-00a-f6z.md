## Agent Output

2026-01-24T12:25:35Z

```
The spec is complete. The `chant status` command was already implemented in the codebase:

- **Status subcommand** defined in `Commands` enum at `src/main.rs:71`
- **cmd_status() function** at `src/main.rs:344-380` that:
  - Counts specs by status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
  - Displays counts in a clear format matching the expected output
  - Shows the total count

Example output:
```
Chant Status
============
  Pending:     0
  In Progress: 1
  Completed:   21
  Failed:      0
  ─────────────
  Total:       22
```

All acceptance criteria have been checked off and committed.```
