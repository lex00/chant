# Add troubleshooting guide

## Context

Users encounter common issues with chant that have known solutions, but there's no troubleshooting guide. The `errors.md` reference lists error types but doesn't help users diagnose problems.

## Content to Document

Create `docs/guides/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues grouped by category:

### Installation & Setup
- macOS code signing: `cargo install` builds get killed (fix: `codesign -f -s -`)
- `chant init` fails in non-git repo
- Shell completion not loading

### Spec Execution
- Agent exits with code 137 (SIGKILL — memory pressure, too many Claude processes)
- Spec stuck in `in_progress` with no running agent (use `chant takeover` or `chant reset`)
- Chain mode stops after first spec (known finalization issue — check if work actually completed)
- `chant work` fails with "not a git repository" in worktree (stale worktree — `chant cleanup`)

### Parallel Mode
- Specs fail immediately with no log/branch/error (worktree race condition — fixed in 0.18.2+)
- API rate limiting errors in parallel mode (reduce `parallel.max_workers`)

### Git & Merge
- Merge conflicts in spec frontmatter (install merge driver: `chant init --merge-driver`)
- `git mv` fails for `.chant/` files (use `mv` directly — some files aren't tracked)
- Archive fails (use full spec ID, not partial)

### Watch & Recovery
- Watch not detecting completed specs (check `.chant-status.json` in worktree)
- Stale worktrees accumulating (run `chant cleanup`)

### Debugging Steps
- How to check agent logs: `.chant/logs/<spec-id>.log`
- How to check spec status: `chant list` or `chant diagnose <id>`
- How to inspect worktree state: `git worktree list`
- How to recover from broken state: `chant reset <id>`

## Task

1. Create `docs/guides/troubleshooting.md` with the content above
2. Add it to `docs/SUMMARY.md` under Guides section (after "Recovery")

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `docs/guides/troubleshooting.md` exists with all categories above
- [x] Each issue has: symptom, cause, fix
- [x] Added to SUMMARY.md under Guides section
- [x] `mdbook build docs/` succeeds (if available)
