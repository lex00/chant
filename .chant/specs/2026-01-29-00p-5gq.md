# Fix unused commit_hash field warning in AgentDetectionResult

## Problem

Compiler warning during build:
```
warning: field `commit_hash` is never read
   --> src/cmd/commits.rs:737:9
    |
735 | pub struct AgentDetectionResult {
    |            -------------------- field in this struct
736 |     /// The commit hash that was checked
737 |     pub commit_hash: String,
    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^
```

The `commit_hash` field is populated in all return values but never actually read by callers. Callers only use `has_agent` and `agent_signature`.

## Solution

**Option A (Recommended): Suppress the warning**

Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` to the field since it's part of the public API and could be useful for debugging or future features:

```rust
pub struct AgentDetectionResult {
    /// The commit hash that was checked
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    pub commit_hash: String,
    /// Whether an agent co-authorship was detected
    pub has_agent: bool,
    /// The agent signature found (if any)
    pub agent_signature: Option<String>,
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Keeps the API complete (callers might want to know which commit was checked)
- Useful for debugging and error messages
- Low cost to maintain
- Preserves information in the return value

**Option B: Remove the field**

If the field is truly never needed:
1. Remove the field from the struct
2. Remove it from all return statements (lines 770, 799, 810)

**Recommendation:** Use Option A to preserve the API.

## Files to Modify

- `src/cmd/commits.rs` - Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` to `commit_hash` field (line 737)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Warning about unused `commit_hash` field is resolved
- [x] `cargo build` produces no warnings for this field
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] `cargo clippy` passes
