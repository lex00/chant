# Fix example config.md files to have YAML frontmatter at top

## Problem

Chant requires config.md to have YAML frontmatter at the very top of the file (between `---` markers on lines 1 and N). Current example configs have markdown content before the frontmatter, causing "Failed to extract frontmatter from config" errors.

## Affected Files

- `examples/approval-workflow/.chant/config.md`
- `examples/kpi-okr-workflow/.chant/config.md`
- `examples/tdd-workflow/.chant/config.md`
- `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/.chant/config.md`
- `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/config.md` (if exists)
- `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/config.md` (if exists)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All config.md files start with `---` on line 1
- [x] YAML frontmatter is valid and parseable
- [x] Markdown content (explanations) comes AFTER the closing `---`
- [x] Running `chant status` in each example directory succeeds without frontmatter errors

## Output



## Verification Results

Successfully fixed config.md files in:
- ✓ approval-workflow: Moved YAML frontmatter to top
- ✓ kpi-okr-workflow: Added YAML frontmatter at top (was missing)
- ✓ tdd-workflow: Converted markdown config to proper YAML frontmatter
- ✓ oss-maintainer-workflow: No config.md found (doesn't require one)
- ✓ research-workflow: No config.md found (doesn't require one)

All `chant status` commands now run without frontmatter errors.
