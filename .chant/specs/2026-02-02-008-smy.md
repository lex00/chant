# Create missing prompts referenced in workflow guides

## Output

## Problem

Workflow guides reference prompts that don't exist in `.chant/prompts/`. Users following the guides will get "prompt not found" errors.

## Missing Prompts

| Prompt | Used By | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `research-synthesis` | research-workflow (academic) | Synthesize multiple sources into themes |
| `research-analysis` | research-workflow, TDD | Analyze data/metrics to produce findings |
| `research` | OSS maintainer | Root cause analysis |
| `reproduce` | OSS maintainer | Create minimal reproduction case |
| `implement` | OSS maintainer | Implement fix based on research |
| `driver` | research-workflow | Coordinate multi-phase work |

## Reference

Existing prompts to use as templates:
- `.chant/prompts/standard.md`
- `.chant/prompts/documentation.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.chant/prompts/research-synthesis.md` exists with instructions for synthesizing multiple sources
- [x] `.chant/prompts/research-analysis.md` exists with instructions for data/metrics analysis
- [x] `.chant/prompts/research.md` exists with instructions for root cause investigation
- [x] `.chant/prompts/reproduce.md` exists with instructions for creating reproduction cases
- [x] `.chant/prompts/implement.md` exists with instructions for implementing fixes from research
- [x] `.chant/prompts/driver.md` exists with instructions for coordinating multi-phase work
