# Investigate mdcat rendering for chant CLI output

## Overview

Investigate how [mdcat](https://github.com/swsnr/mdcat) or similar markdown rendering can enhance chant's CLI output.

## Questions to Answer

### 1. Where could markdown rendering help?
- [ ] `chant show` - Display spec content with formatting
- [ ] `chant list` - Could descriptions benefit from rendering?
- [ ] `chant diagnose` - Render diagnostic output
- [ ] Agent output display - Format agent responses
- [ ] Help text - Render embedded markdown

### 2. Implementation options
- [ ] Use mdcat as external dependency (shell out)
- [ ] Use pulldown-cmark + termcolor for native rendering
- [ ] Use termimad crate (terminal markdown rendering)
- [ ] Use bat for syntax highlighting (like mdcat does)

### 3. Tradeoffs
- Binary size impact
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows terminal support)
- Performance overhead
- Optional vs required feature

### 4. User experience considerations
- Should rendering be opt-in (`--render`) or opt-out (`--plain`)?
- Respect NO_COLOR environment variable
- Handle non-TTY output (piping)
- Graceful degradation if terminal doesn't support features

## Potential Crates

| Crate | Description | Stars |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| termimad | Markdown for terminals | ~800 |
| pulldown-cmark | Markdown parser | ~1.8k |
| syntect | Syntax highlighting | ~4k |
| bat | cat with wings | ~40k |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document which commands would benefit from markdown rendering
- [ ] Evaluate implementation options (native vs external)
- [ ] Recommend approach with pros/cons
- [ ] If recommending implementation: create follow-up code spec
- [ ] Consider impact on binary size and dependencies
