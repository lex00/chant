# Fix test-examples.sh to treat rejected specs as expected failures

## Problem

Script marks "rejected" spec errors as unexpected failures. The error "Cannot work on spec... it has been rejected" should be treated as expected, like "requires approval".

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Script recognizes "rejected" in error output as expected failure
- [x] 003-rejected-change shows as expected failure, not unexpected
- [x] Exit code is 0 when only expected failures occur
