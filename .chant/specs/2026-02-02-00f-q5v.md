# Audit guides and examples for consistency, testability, and documentation quality

## Overview

Three independent workstreams to make examples production-ready:

1. **Consistency** - Standardize README structure and spec formatting across all 5 examples
2. **Test Infrastructure** - Create `test-examples.sh` that runs specs via Claude Code
3. **Validation Setup** - Add `test-assertions.sh` to each example for output validation

## Current Examples

| Example | Pattern | Specs |
|---------|---------|-------|
| approval-workflow | Independent | 3 |
| kpi-okr-workflow | Driver + members | 4 |
| tdd-workflow | Driver + members | 4 |
| research-workflow | Independent paths | 2 |
| oss-maintainer-workflow | Sequential chain | 6 |

## Part 1: Consistency Audit

Standardize all examples to identical structure.

### README Template
Each example README must have sections: Overview, Structure, Usage, Testing.

### Spec Formatting
Frontmatter field order: type, status, prompt, depends_on, informed_by, target_files.

### Acceptance Criteria (Part 1)
- [ ] All 5 example READMEs follow identical section structure
- [ ] All specs use consistent frontmatter field ordering
- [ ] Each README documents its execution pattern

---

## Part 2: Test Infrastructure

Create `examples/test-examples.sh` script.

### Execution Patterns
Script must detect and handle:
- Driver pattern: `chant work <driver-spec>`
- Chain pattern: `chant work --chain <specs...>`
- Independent: run each spec separately

### Acceptance Criteria (Part 2)
- [ ] `examples/test-examples.sh` exists and is executable
- [ ] Script shows usage with `--help`
- [ ] `./test-examples.sh all` runs all examples via claude CLI
- [ ] `./test-examples.sh <name>` runs single example
- [ ] Script detects execution pattern per example

---

## Part 3: Validation Setup

Add validation to each example.

### Validation Approach
Each example gets `test-assertions.sh` that validates semantic correctness:
- Required files exist
- Files contain expected key content
- Specs completed successfully

### Acceptance Criteria (Part 3)
- [ ] Each example has `test-assertions.sh`
- [ ] Assertions check file existence and key content
- [ ] `examples/README.md` documents how to run tests
- [ ] All examples pass validation after execution
