# Investigate uncommitted formatting changes - ensure fmt runs before commit

## Problem

After working specs, `src/diagnose.rs` had uncommitted formatting changes that should have been applied before the commit. This suggests:
1. Code was written without running `cargo fmt`
2. The commit was created before formatting was applied
3. User left with dirty working tree

## Questions to Answer

1. Where in the chant workflow should `cargo fmt` run?
   - Before commit in finalize_spec()?
   - As a pre-commit hook?
   - Agent should run it as part of workflow?

2. Should chant automatically run `cargo fmt` before committing?
   - Pro: Ensures consistent formatting
   - Con: May be slow, may conflict with user preferences

3. Should this be configurable?
   - Add `auto_format: true` to chant config?
   - Respect existing pre-commit hooks?

4. What about other linting (clippy)?
   - Should clippy also run before commit?
   - Or just rely on CI?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Investigate where formatting should occur in chant workflow
- [x] Determine if auto-formatting should be built into chant
- [x] Recommend solution (auto-format, pre-commit hook, or agent responsibility)
- [x] If implementing: ensure all code changes are formatted before commit
- [x] Document decision in findings

## Investigation Findings

### Current Workflow Architecture

After analyzing the chant codebase, the workflow is:

1. **Spec Execution**: Agent works in isolated worktree (via `create_worktree()` in `src/worktree.rs`)
2. **Merging**: After agent completes, `worktree::merge_and_cleanup()` merges branch to main via `git merge --ff-only`
3. **Spec Finalization**: `finalize_spec()` updates spec status to `completed` and saves the spec file
4. **Transcript Commit**: `commit_transcript()` (recently added in spec 2026-01-25-001-xud) commits the transcript
5. **Result**: User gets working tree with all committed changes

### The Formatting Issue

The problem identified: Code written in the worktree is not formatted before being merged to main. While the previous spec (2026-01-25-001-xud) solved the transcript not being committed, it didn't address code formatting.

**Root Cause**: The agent runs code, creates commits in the worktree, but doesn't run `cargo fmt` before the final merge to main.

### Three Possible Solutions

#### Option 1: Agent Responsibility (Current State - NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Agents should run `just fmt` as part of their workflow before completion
- **Problem**: Not enforced, relies on agent discipline; formatting can be forgotten
- **Evidence**: Previous work left `src/diagnose.rs` with formatting differences

#### Option 2: Pre-commit Hook (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Use git pre-commit hooks to run formatting automatically
- **Problem**: Requires user setup, not part of chant workflow; hooks can be skipped; conflicts with user preferences
- **Problem**: Chant is designed to be deterministic; user-configured hooks break reproducibility

#### Option 3: Auto-format Before Merge (RECOMMENDED)
- Run `cargo fmt` in the worktree BEFORE `worktree::merge_and_cleanup()`
- **Advantages**:
  - Automatic and deterministic - no agent needs to remember
  - Aligns with chant's principle that "chant gets to write files"
  - Ensures clean formatting before merge to main
  - Non-breaking - formatting changes are local to the branch
  - Idempotent - running fmt multiple times has no additional effect
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Adds slight overhead to spec execution (fmt is fast)
  - Assumes project uses rustfmt (reasonable for Rust projects)
  - Could conflict with controversial formatter decisions (but that's the linter's job)

### Recommendation

**Implement Option 3: Auto-format in worktree before merge**

**Why**:
- Chant's philosophy is to automate reproducible workflows
- Users should not need to remember formatting - it should "just work"
- Formatting is a hygiene concern, not a feature concern
- The worktree branch is isolated until merge, so formatting changes don't affect main during dev
- Aligns with how `just check` already includes `fmt-check`

**Implementation**:
1. Add `cargo fmt` call in `worktree::merge_and_cleanup()` BEFORE `git merge --ff-only`
2. Alternatively: Add it as a separate pre-merge step in `main.rs`
3. No user configuration needed - formatting is automatic
4. Consider: Make this a project-wide setting that respects .rustfmt.toml

### Verdict

**This is an infrastructure issue, not an agent issue.** The formatting should be handled by chant's infrastructure before merge, not delegated to the agent. This ensures:
- All specs produce consistently formatted code
- No spec gets "blamed" for formatting issues
- Formatting is non-negotiable (like a build requirement)
- User never sees formatting diffs (cleaner main branch)

## Agent Output

```
I'll start by examining the spec and understanding the current state of the codebase. Let me read the spec file first to get the full context.
Now let me create a todo list to track my investigation and then examine the relevant code files.
Now let me examine the main relevant files: `src/main.rs` (to understand the workflow) and `src/diagnose.rs` (the file with formatting issues).
Good. Now let me look at the main.rs file in sections to find the relevant parts about spec execution and commit handling.
Let me search more broadly for the spec workflow:
Good! Now let me read the relevant sections of main.rs that handle finalize_spec:
Let me see what happens after the spec is finalized - where the commit is created:
Let me search for where changes are committed during spec execution:
Let me look at the worktree.rs file:
Now let me look at the mcp.rs file to understand how the agent commits changes:
Let me look for how commits are made in the codebase:
Let me check line 2421 in main.rs for the commit context:
Let me search for where changes are actually committed during spec execution. Let me look for the workflow:
Let me look at the specification of the previous issue that caused the formatting problem:
Good! Now I understand the context. The previous spec (2026-01-25-001-xud) was about ensuring the agent output transcript gets committed. But there were still formatting issues. Let me check the git status to see what uncommitted formatting changes exist:
I see the git status shows spec file modifications, but let me check if there are any formatting differences in source files:
No formatting differences. Let me look at the git history to see where the formatting issue was mentioned:
I see! Commit `c657db3` shows `style: Apply rustfmt to diagnose.rs`. This was a manual formatting step. Let me check the justfile to see if there's a built-in format command:
Now let me update my todo list and provide my findings and recommendations:
Now let me update the spec file with my findings and recommendations:
Now let me save the spec and update the todo list:
Perfect! Now let me commit the spec updates:
Excellent! Let me verify the commit was created:
Perfect! The spec has been completed successfully. Let me create a summary of the investigation:

## Investigation Complete ✓

I've thoroughly investigated the formatting issue and provided comprehensive findings in the spec. Here's what I discovered:

### Key Findings

**Current Problem**: After spec execution, code written in worktrees isn't formatted before merging to main.

**Root Cause**: While agents run code and create commits, `cargo fmt` isn't enforced before the final merge to main.

### Three Potential Solutions Analyzed

1. **Agent Responsibility** - Not recommended (relies on discipline, gets forgotten)
2. **Pre-commit Hooks** - Not recommended (breaks reproducibility, requires user setup)
3. **Auto-format Before Merge** - **RECOMMENDED** ✓
   - Automatic and deterministic
   - Aligns with chant's philosophy that "chant gets to write files"
   - Ensures clean formatting before merge to main
   - Minimal overhead (fmt is fast)

### Recommendation

**Run `cargo fmt` in the worktree BEFORE `worktree::merge_and_cleanup()`**

This is an **infrastructure issue**, not an agent issue. Formatting should be automatic and non-negotiable, like a build requirement. This ensures:
- All specs produce consistently formatted code
- No formatting diffs pollute the main branch
- Users never need to remember formatting
- Works across all specs uniformly

The spec file has been updated with all findings and all acceptance criteria are now checked off. The investigation is documented in the spec for future reference.```
