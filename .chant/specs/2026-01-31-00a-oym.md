# Test spec with good structure and criteria

## Problem

When creating new specs, it's helpful to have an example that demonstrates best practices for spec structure. A well-structured spec should include:

- Clear problem statement explaining the context and motivation
- Concrete solution approach outlining the strategy
- Implementation details with code examples or pseudocode
- Specific, measurable acceptance criteria that can be checked off
- Proper frontmatter metadata

This spec serves as a reference template for creating high-quality specs.

## Solution

Create a comprehensive example spec that showcases:

1. **Problem Section**: Explains *why* this work is needed and what issue it addresses
2. **Solution Section**: Describes *what* approach will be taken, at a high level
3. **Implementation Section**: Shows *how* to implement the solution with specific technical details
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Lists concrete, testable outcomes that must be met

The spec should be self-documenting and serve as both an example and a test of the spec system itself.

## Implementation

### Structure Components

1. **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata including type, status, optional fields like target_files, depends_on, etc.

```yaml
---
type: code
status: in_progress
target_files:
  - path/to/file.rs
depends_on:
  - other-spec-id
---
```

2. **Title**: H1 heading that clearly describes the spec's purpose

3. **Problem Section**: Context and motivation
   - What issue exists today?
   - Why does it need to be solved?
   - What are the consequences of not addressing it?

4. **Solution Section**: High-level approach
   - What strategy will be used?
   - What are the key components?
   - Are there alternatives considered?

5. **Implementation Section**: Technical details
   - Code snippets or pseudocode
   - Specific files to modify
   - API changes or new functions
   - Step-by-step approach

6. **Acceptance Criteria**: Checkboxes for verification
   - Each criterion should be specific and measurable
   - Use `- [ ]` format for unchecked items
   - Should cover functionality, tests, formatting, and documentation
   - Mark complete with `- [x]` as work progresses

### Example Acceptance Criteria Format

Good criteria are:
- **Specific**: "Add function `parse_markdown` to src/parser.rs" (not "add parsing")
- **Testable**: "All tests pass with `cargo test`" (objective verification)
- **Atomic**: Each checkbox represents one clear outcome
- **Complete**: Cover implementation, tests, formatting, linting, and verification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Spec includes clear Problem section explaining context and motivation
- [x] Spec includes Solution section outlining the approach
- [x] Spec includes Implementation section with technical details
- [x] Spec includes specific, measurable Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Frontmatter includes appropriate metadata (type, status)
- [x] Title is clear and descriptive (H1 heading)
- [x] Each acceptance criterion is atomic and testable
- [x] Acceptance criteria cover implementation, testing, and verification
- [x] Code examples or pseudocode are provided where appropriate
- [x] Spec demonstrates best practices for structure and clarity

```
I'll implement this test spec following the structured approach.
The spec file only has the title. This appears to be a meta-task to create a proper test spec with good structure and criteria as an example. Let me check if there are other specs or documentation about what structure is expected.
Now I understand the task better. This spec is about creating an example spec with good structure, including acceptance criteria, clear instructions, and proper documentation. Let me look at a few more examples and then create a well-structured spec.
Perfect! Now I have good examples of well-structured specs. Let me create a comprehensive spec example with all the right elements: problem statement, solution approach, implementation details, and clear acceptance criteria.
Now let me verify the spec is complete and check off the criteria:
The spec now has all the necessary components. Let me check off all the acceptance criteria since the spec demonstrates all of them:
Now let me add the model field to the frontmatter and verify the build:
## Summary

Created a comprehensive example spec demonstrating best practices for spec structure.

- Added Problem section explaining context and motivation
- Added Solution section outlining high-level approach
- Added Implementation section with technical details and code examples
- Added clear, atomic acceptance criteria covering all aspects
- Included examples of good criteria (specific, testable, atomic, complete)
- Spec serves as both a reference template and test of the spec system

All acceptance criteria met and committed.```
