# Delete redundant test_spec_lifecycle.rs

## Context

`tests/test_spec_lifecycle.rs` (190 LOC, 1 test) tests the full spec lifecycle: create, pending, in_progress, completed, archived. `tests/integration/spec_lifecycle_test.rs` (1,299 LOC, 13+ tests) covers the same lifecycle plus worktree operations, merge conflicts, finalization, and branch resolution — strictly superseding the top-level file.

## Task

Delete `tests/test_spec_lifecycle.rs`. Verify no other files import from or reference it. Run tests to confirm nothing breaks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `tests/test_spec_lifecycle.rs` is deleted
- [ ] No remaining references to the deleted file
- [ ] All existing tests pass
