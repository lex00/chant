# Investigate status reset - manual edit vs CLI command

## Question

When a spec fails or gets stuck in `in_progress`, how should users reset it to `pending`?

## Options

### Option A: Manual edit
- User edits the spec file directly
- Changes `status: in_progress` to `status: pending`
- Pro: Simple, no new code
- Con: Error-prone, might forget to clear other fields

### Option B: CLI command
```bash
chant reset <spec-id>        # Reset to pending
chant reset --status failed  # Set specific status
```
- Pro: Safe, clears related fields (completed_at, commits, model)
- Con: More code to maintain

### Option C: Both
- Manual edit always works (it's just a file)
- CLI command for convenience and safety

## Fields to clear on reset

When resetting to `pending`:
- `status` → `pending`
- `completed_at` → remove
- `commits` → remove
- `model` → remove (or keep?)
- Agent Output section → remove?

## Questions

- [ ] Should reset clear the Agent Output section?
- [ ] Should reset require confirmation?
- [ ] Should there be a `chant retry` that resets and immediately works?
- [ ] What about resetting a group driver - reset all members too?

## Recommendation

Document findings and recommend approach.
