# Document acceptance criteria validation

Add documentation for acceptance criteria validation (implemented in spec 00g-it2).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Document that unchecked boxes prevent completion
- [x] Explain the validation happens after agent exits
- [x] Show the warning message format
- [x] Document --force to skip validation

## Example Content

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

Chant validates that all acceptance criteria checkboxes are checked before marking a spec complete.

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement login endpoint
- [ ] Add rate limiting        <- Unchecked!
- [x] Write tests
```

If unchecked boxes exist, chant shows a warning and fails:

```
⚠ Found 1 unchecked acceptance criterion.
Use --force to skip this validation.
error: Cannot complete spec with 1 unchecked acceptance criteria
```

The spec is marked as `failed` until all criteria are checked.

### Skipping Validation

Use `--force` to complete despite unchecked boxes:

```bash
chant work 001 --force
```

### Best Practice

Agents should check off criteria as they complete each item:
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in the spec file
- This creates a clear record of completion

## Implementation Notes

- Add to docs/concepts/specs.md
- Also mention in docs/reference/cli.md under work command
