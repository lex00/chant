# Add single-spec investigation mode to Advanced Patterns

## Context

User feedback: "The spec-per-stage overhead is high for a single investigator. Creating, formatting, updating status, checking acceptance criteria for each stage adds friction. The specs are valuable as documentation artifacts, but the ceremony feels designed for multi-agent orchestration rather than a human + one agent working a problem. Consider a lighter investigation journal mode where a single spec accumulates findings across stages, with stage markers rather than separate files."

## Task

Add a "Single-Spec Investigation Mode" section to `08-advanced.md` that documents how to use one spec with stage markers (markdown headings) instead of the full 6-spec chain. Show a template with sections for each stage within one document.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `08-advanced.md` has a new "Single-Spec Investigation Mode" section
- [x] Section includes a complete single-spec template with stage markers as headings
- [x] Explains when to use single-spec mode (solo investigator, single session) vs full chain (multi-agent, handoffs, complex issues)
- [x] Template preserves the same phase order and deliverables as the full workflow
