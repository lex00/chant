# Mark unimplemented features as planned in docs

Documentation includes features that aren't implemented yet. Mark these clearly as "Planned" to avoid confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Mark unimplemented CLI commands as planned (dag, search, split, daemon, queue, lock, agent worker)
- [x] Mark unimplemented spec states as planned (waiting, cancelled)
- [x] Mark unimplemented MCP tools as planned (chant_commit, chant_verify)
- [x] Mark unimplemented config options as planned (schema, scale, environment overrides)
- [x] Mark unimplemented spec commands as planned (cancel, resume, reopen, edit, verify)
- [x] Remove or mark prompt registry as planned (chant prompt add)

## Format

Use a consistent marker:

```markdown
## DAG Visualization (Planned)

> **Status: Planned** - This feature is on the roadmap but not yet implemented.

```bash
chant dag                # ASCII dependency graph
```
```

## Implementation Notes

- Go through each doc file and identify unimplemented features
- Add "(Planned)" suffix to section headers
- Add status callout at start of section
- This prevents users from trying to use features that don't exist yet

## Agent Output

2026-01-24T12:52:30Z

```
Done! I've completed the spec to mark unimplemented features as planned in the docs. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary

The documentation already had many features marked as "(Planned)" with status callouts. I added the missing markers to:

1. **docs/reference/search.md** - Added "(Planned)" marker to the page title with a note that `chant list --label` is available for filtering

2. **docs/reference/reports.md** - Added "(Planned)" marker since `chant export` is not yet implemented

3. **docs/reference/schema.md** - Added "(Planned)" marker to the "Linter as Coach" section since basic `chant lint` works but advanced features like quality scoring, learning paths, and `chant health` are not implemented

4. **docs/guides/ecosystem.md** - Added "(Planned)" marker to the Discovery section for commands like `chant prompt search`, `chant prompt popular`

Features that were already properly marked:
- CLI commands: dag, search, split, daemon, queue, lock, agent worker, edit
- MCP tools: chant_commit, chant_verify  
- Config options: schema, scale, environment overrides
- Spec states: waiting, cancelled (with inline notes)
- Spec commands: cancel, resume, reopen, edit, verify
- Prompt registry: chant prompt add (in quickstart.md, prompt-examples.md, ecosystem.md)
- Lifecycle commands: cleanup, disk, export, backup, index
