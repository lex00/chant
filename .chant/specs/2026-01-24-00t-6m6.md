# Mark unimplemented features as planned in docs

Documentation includes features that aren't implemented yet. Mark these clearly as "Planned" to avoid confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Mark unimplemented CLI commands as planned (dag, search, split, daemon, queue, lock, agent worker)
- [ ] Mark unimplemented spec states as planned (waiting, cancelled)
- [ ] Mark unimplemented MCP tools as planned (chant_commit, chant_verify)
- [ ] Mark unimplemented config options as planned (schema, scale, environment overrides)
- [ ] Mark unimplemented spec commands as planned (cancel, resume, reopen, edit, verify)
- [ ] Remove or mark prompt registry as planned (chant prompt add)

## Format

Use a consistent marker:

```markdown
## DAG Visualization (Planned)

> **Status: Planned** - This feature is on the roadmap but not yet implemented.

```bash
chant dag                # ASCII dependency graph
```
```

## Implementation Notes

- Go through each doc file and identify unimplemented features
- Add "(Planned)" suffix to section headers
- Add status callout at start of section
- This prevents users from trying to use features that don't exist yet
