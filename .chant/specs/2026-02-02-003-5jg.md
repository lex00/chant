# Revise OSS maintainer workflow guide with research phases and fork-staging pattern

## Output

## Current Structure

1. Triage
2. Reproduction
3. Research (root cause)
4. Implementation
5. Review
6. Documentation
7. Release

## New Structure (per user requirements)

1. **Comprehension research** - understand what the issue is about (type: research, output: target_files)
2. **Reproducibility** - automatic if possible, otherwise provide instructions + assisted (type: task)
3. **Root cause research** - determine what to fix (type: research, informed_by: comprehension, output: target_files)
4. **Codebase sprawl research** - expand view based on root cause (type: research, informed_by: root_cause, output: target_files)
5. **Fork + staging PR** - fix in fork, create fork-internal PR for review (type: code, informed_by: sprawl research)
6. **Human gate → upstream PR** - after fork review passes, human creates real PR

## Key Changes

- Split research into 3 phases: comprehension → root cause → sprawl
- Use `target_files` on research outputs to feed implementation
- Use `informed_by` to chain research → impl
- Fork-internal PR pattern (staging PR against own fork, not upstream)
- Explicit human gate before upstream PR

## Files to Update

- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/index.md` - new diagram and stages
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/01-triage.md` → rename to `01-comprehension.md`
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/02-reproduction.md` - update for auto/assisted
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/03-research.md` → split into `03-root-cause.md` and `04-sprawl.md`
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/04-implementation.md` → `05-fork-fix.md` with staging PR pattern
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/05-review.md` → `06-upstream-pr.md` with human gate
- Remove/consolidate 06-documentation.md, 07-release.md, 08-advanced.md, 09-example.md

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] index.md has new 6-phase diagram: comprehension → repro → root-cause → sprawl → fork-fix → upstream-pr
- [x] Research specs demonstrate `target_files` output pattern
- [x] Implementation spec demonstrates `informed_by` referencing research target_files
- [x] Fork-internal PR (staging PR) pattern documented in fork-fix phase
- [x] Human gate documented before upstream PR creation
