# Add approval workflow for agent-assisted commits

PROBLEM:
When an AI agent (Claude, etc.) assists with code changes and creates commits, there's currently no built-in mechanism to require human review before those changes go live. This creates risk:
- Agent-written code may have subtle bugs
- Security issues could be introduced
- Business logic could be misunderstood
- No forcing function for code review

USER NEED:
A flag/toggle that makes commits with agent co-authorship automatically require approval before they can be merged or deployed.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

Option A: Automatic approval requirement detection
- Scan commit messages for 'Co-Authored-By: Claude' or other agent signatures
- Automatically set spec frontmatter 'approval: required: true' when agent commit detected
- Existing approval system (chant approve/reject) handles the review

Option B: Config flag for agent review policy
- Add config setting: 'require_approval_for_agent_work: true'
- When enabled, any spec worked by agent requires approval
- Can be set per-project or globally

Option C: Git hook integration
- Pre-merge hook checks for agent co-authorship
- Blocks merge unless spec has approval: status=approved
- Works with existing git workflow

RECOMMENDED: Option A + B combined
- Auto-detect agent work (Option A)
- Allow config override to require/skip (Option B)
- Use existing approval system (no new commands needed)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA should include:
- Detect agent co-authorship in commits
- Auto-set approval requirement when agent detected
- Config setting to enable/disable auto-requirement
- Work with existing chant approve/reject commands
- Clear messaging when approval is required
- Prevent merge/finalize without approval (when required)
- Tests for detection and enforcement
