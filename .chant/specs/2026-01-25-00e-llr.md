# Investigate agent guide install for slash commands and provider config

## Overview

Investigate options for offering an "agent guide install" feature that would configure AI assistants (Claude, etc.) with optimal settings for operating chant.

## Problem

Users new to chant need to:
1. Understand the chant workflow (specs, not direct coding)
2. Configure their AI assistant to follow chant conventions
3. Set up slash commands or shortcuts for common operations
4. Know the right prompts/instructions to give their agent

## Potential Solution: `chant init --agent`

A guided setup that:
1. Detects or asks which AI provider/tool is being used
2. Installs appropriate configuration files
3. Provides templates for CLAUDE.md or similar

## Questions to Answer

### 1. What should be configured?

**For Claude Code:**
- [ ] CLAUDE.md file (already exists, could be templated)
- [ ] Slash commands (e.g., `/spec`, `/work`, `/list`)
- [ ] Custom instructions or system prompts
- [ ] MCP server configuration

**For other providers:**
- [ ] Cursor rules file
- [ ] Continue.dev configuration
- [ ] Aider configuration
- [ ] Generic .ai-instructions file

### 2. What templates are needed?

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| CLAUDE.md | Project-level instructions for Claude |
| .cursorrules | Cursor AI configuration |
| .continue/config.json | Continue.dev settings |
| .aider.conf.yml | Aider configuration |

### 3. Slash commands to offer

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| /spec | `just chant add "description"` |
| /work | `just chant work <id>` |
| /list | `just chant list` |
| /show | `just chant show <id>` |
| /archive | `just chant archive <id>` |

### 4. Implementation approach

Options:
- [ ] `chant init --agent claude` - Provider-specific setup
- [ ] `chant init --agent` - Interactive wizard
- [ ] `chant doctor` - Check and fix agent configuration
- [ ] Separate `chant-agent` companion tool

### 5. Distribution considerations

- Should templates live in the chant binary or be fetched?
- How to handle template updates?
- Should this be a plugin system?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document what configurations would help each provider
- [ ] Identify which providers to support initially
- [ ] Design the `chant init --agent` UX flow
- [ ] Determine where templates should live
- [ ] Recommend MVP scope (which providers, which features)
- [ ] Create follow-up implementation spec if warranted
