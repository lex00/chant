# Document agent output appending to specs

Add documentation for agent output appending feature (implemented in spec 00h-2sy).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Document that agent output is appended after completion
- [x] Show the format of the Agent Output section
- [x] Explain truncation for long outputs (>5000 chars)
- [x] Note that multiple replays create multiple output sections

## Example Content

### Agent Output

After successful completion, chant appends the agent's output to the spec file:

```markdown
## Agent Output

2026-01-24T15:30:00Z

\`\`\`
Done! I've implemented the authentication middleware.

Summary:
- Added JWT validation in src/auth/middleware.go
- Added tests in src/auth/middleware_test.go
- All 5 tests pass
\`\`\`
```

### Multiple Runs

Each replay with `--force` appends a new output section:

```markdown
## Agent Output

2026-01-24T15:30:00Z
[first run output]

## Agent Output

2026-01-24T16:00:00Z
[replay output - agent detected implementation exists]
```

### Truncation

Outputs longer than 5000 characters are truncated with a note.

## Implementation Notes

- Add to docs/concepts/specs.md in a new "Agent Output" section
- This creates an audit trail of agent work
