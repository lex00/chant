# CI enhancements: ensure CI lints first

Ensure that CI runs linting checks before other steps.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CI workflow runs cargo fmt check before clippy
- [x] CI workflow runs clippy lint before build step
- [x] All current lint errors are fixed in the codebase

## Implementation Notes

- Reorder CI steps: fmt check → clippy → build → test
- Fix any existing clippy warnings or errors
