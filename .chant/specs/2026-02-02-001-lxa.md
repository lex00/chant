# Hide merge-driver command from help output (internal git command)

## Agent Output

2026-02-02T22:22:05Z

```
I'll implement this spec to hide the merge-driver command from help output.
## Summary

Added `hide = true` attribute to the merge-driver command in src/main.rs:571.

- Command no longer appears in `chant --help` output
- Verified with clippy and manual testing```
