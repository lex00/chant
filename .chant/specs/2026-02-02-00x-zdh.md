# Remove ecosystem.md and consolidate provider config to reference docs

## Context

Per research in `.chant/research/guide-evaluation.md`, ecosystem.md should be removed because 90% describes unimplemented features (prompt registry planned for v0.4.0+), causing user confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Delete `docs/guides/ecosystem.md`
- [x] Remove ecosystem.md entry from `docs/README.md`
- [x] Remove ecosystem.md entry from `docs/SUMMARY.md`
- [x] Create or update `docs/reference/providers.md` with provider configuration (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama)
- [x] Verify `scripts/test-docs.sh` passes (no broken links)

## Agent Output

2026-02-02T15:17:31Z

```
I'll implement this task to remove ecosystem.md and consolidate provider configuration.

- Removed entries from README.md and SUMMARY.md
- Created providers.md with Claude, OpenAI, and Ollama configuration
