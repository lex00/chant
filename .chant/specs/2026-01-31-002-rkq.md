# Add output-concise prompt extension to reduce agent transcript verbosity

## Problem

Agent transcripts captured in spec output are excessively verbose. Looking at completed specs like `2026-01-31-001-gbj`, the output contains step-by-step narration:

```
Let me search for where this warning is implemented.
Let me search more broadly...
Perfect! I found the function...
Now let me simplify it...
```

This noise obscures the useful information (the summary at the end). The `## Agent Output` section should contain concise, actionable information about what changed.

## Solution

Create an `output-concise` prompt extension that instructs agents to minimize narration and produce structured summaries. Enable it by default in chant's own config.

## Implementation

### Create extension file

`.chant/prompts/extensions/output-concise.md`:

```markdown
---
name: output-concise
purpose: Reduce agent output verbosity
---

## Output Style

Work quietly. Minimize narration of your process.

**Do not output:**
- "Let me...", "Now I'll...", "I'm going to..."
- Step-by-step commentary on tool usage
- Thinking out loud

**Do output:**
- Errors or blockers that need attention
- Key decisions that affect the implementation
- A final summary when complete

**Final summary format** (5-10 lines):

```
## Summary

Changed [files] to [accomplish goal].

- Key change 1
- Key change 2

[Any follow-up specs created or issues noted]
```
```

### Enable by default

Update `.chant/config.md`:

```yaml
defaults:
  prompt: standard
  prompt_extensions:
    - output-concise
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `.chant/prompts/extensions/output-concise.md` with guidance above
- [x] Add `prompt_extensions: [output-concise]` to `.chant/config.md`
- [x] Verify extension is appended to assembled prompts
- [x] Test with `chant work` on a simple spec and confirm reduced verbosity
