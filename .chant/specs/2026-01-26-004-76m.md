# Create documentation prompt for generating docs from tracked source

Create the `documentation` prompt that guides agents to generate documentation from tracked source files.

## Context

Documentation specs track source files and generate docs:

```yaml
---
type: documentation
tracks:
  - src/auth/*.rs
target_files:
  - docs/auth.md
---
```

The agent needs guidance to:
1. Read all tracked files
2. Understand what to document
3. Generate comprehensive, accurate docs
4. Match the target format

## Prompt Content

The prompt should include:

### Principles
- **Accurate** — Match the source exactly
- **Complete** — Document all public interfaces
- **Clear** — Write for the target audience
- **Maintainable** — Structure for easy updates

### Process
1. Read all files matching `tracks:` patterns
2. Identify what needs documenting (public APIs, types, functions)
3. Generate documentation in `target_files:` format
4. Include examples where helpful
5. Verify against acceptance criteria

### Format Guidance
- For API docs: document every public function/type
- For architecture docs: explain structure and relationships
- For README: focus on usage and getting started
- Include code examples from the tracked source

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Prompt file created at `.chant/prompts/documentation.md`
- [x] Prompt explains how to read tracked files
- [x] Prompt explains documentation principles
- [x] Prompt provides format guidance
- [x] Prompt is clear and actionable
