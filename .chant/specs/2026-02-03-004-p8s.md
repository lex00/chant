# CLI: Create unified validation framework for lint/verify/config-validate

Create a unified validation framework that consolidates common validation patterns used across lint, verify, and config-validate commands.

## Background

Currently, chant has three separate validation operations:
1. `chant lint` - validates spec structure and quality
2. `chant verify` - verifies specs against acceptance criteria
3. `chant config --validate` - validates configuration files

These commands use different error reporting patterns and severity levels. A unified framework will improve consistency and make it easier to add new validation operations.

## Implementation

Create `src/cmd/validate.rs` module that provides:
- Common `ValidationIssue` type with severity levels (Info, Warning, Error)
- `ValidationResult` type to collect and report validation results
- `ValidationCategory` enum to distinguish validation types (Lint, Verify, Config)
- Conversion functions from existing types (e.g., LintDiagnostic) to the unified types

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create src/cmd/validate.rs module
- [x] Define ValidationIssue struct with severity, category, item_id, message, and suggestion fields
- [x] Define Severity enum with Info, Warning, and Error levels
- [x] Define ValidationCategory enum with Lint, Verify, and Config variants
- [x] Define ValidationResult struct to collect validation issues and provide summary display
- [x] Add module to src/cmd/mod.rs exports
- [x] Make lint module public in src/cmd/spec/mod.rs
- [x] Add conversion from lint::Severity to unified Severity
- [x] Add conversion from lint::LintDiagnostic to ValidationIssue
- [x] Add unit tests for ValidationIssue, ValidationResult, and conversions
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Run cargo fmt
- [x] Run cargo clippy
