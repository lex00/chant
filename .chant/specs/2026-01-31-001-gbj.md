# Simplify target_files mismatch warning - make it concise and less alarming

## Problem

The current warning is overwhelming and confusing:
- Too verbose (20+ lines)
- Lists 5 possible causes when usually it's just "agent predicted wrong files"
- The breakdown of "with changes" vs "no changes" is hard to parse

## Solution

Make it a simple 2-3 line warning:

```
Note: Spec 41u predicted changes to src/cmd/work.rs but actual changes were in src/spec.rs
      (This is normal - agent predictions aren't always accurate)
```

Or for multiple files:
```
Note: Spec 2mk predicted [src/main.rs] but changed [src/templates.rs]
      (Prediction mismatch - implementation is fine)
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Warning is 3 lines or less
- [x] Uses "Note:" instead of "Warning:" (less alarming)
- [x] Shows predicted vs actual files concisely
- [x] Includes brief reassurance that this is normal
- [x] Remove the long "This may indicate" list
