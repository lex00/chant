# Audit mdBook for broken links - fix GitHub icon link

## Problem

The mdBook documentation has broken links that need to be identified and fixed. Specifically, the GitHub icon link in the top-right corner is broken and not pointing to the correct repository.

Broken links create a poor user experience and make it difficult for users to navigate the documentation or find the source repository.

## Solution

1. **Audit all links in mdBook configuration and documentation**
   - Check `book.toml` for broken external links (GitHub, social links, etc.)
   - Verify all internal cross-references between documentation pages
   - Test all external resource links

2. **Fix the GitHub icon link**
   - Locate GitHub icon configuration in `book.toml`
   - Update to correct repository URL
   - Verify it opens in new tab and points to correct location

3. **Fix any other broken links discovered during audit**
   - Internal doc links (relative paths, anchors)
   - External resource links
   - Image links

4. **Add link checking to CI if not already present**
   - Consider adding mdbook-linkcheck or similar tool
   - Prevent future broken link regressions
