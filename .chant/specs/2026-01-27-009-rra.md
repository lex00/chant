# Fix completed_by field documentation discrepancy

## Problem

Documentation claims a `completed_by` field is auto-populated during spec completion, but this field does NOT exist in the implementation.

**Documented** (docs/enterprise/enterprise.md:301-306):
```yaml
---
status: completed
completed_by: alice@company.com   # From git user
completed_at: 2026-01-22T15:30:00Z
model: claude-haiku-4-5
---
```

**Reality** (src/spec.rs:57-59):
- `completed_at` field exists ✅
- `model` field exists ✅
- `completed_by` field does NOT exist ❌

This is misleading to users who expect this audit trail field.

## Solution

**Option A (Recommended):** Remove `completed_by` from documentation

Update docs/enterprise/enterprise.md section "Audit Trail" to remove mention of `completed_by` field. The audit trail still provides value with `completed_at`, `model`, and `commits` tracking.

**Option B:** Implement the field (requires code changes - out of scope for this spec)

If implementation is desired, that should be a separate code spec to:
- Add `completed_by: Option<String>` to SpecFrontmatter
- Populate it during finalization from git user.email
- Update serialization/parsing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Review docs/enterprise/enterprise.md lines 296-315 (Audit Trail section)
- [ ] Remove or comment out `completed_by` field from example
- [ ] Update audit trail description to reflect actual fields (completed_at, model, commits)
- [ ] Verify no other mentions of `completed_by` in documentation
- [ ] Check docs build successfully: `cd docs && mdbook build`
