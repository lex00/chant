# Label unimplemented features in docs and identify stale content

Mark planned features clearly, identify outdated examples or descriptions, ensure roadmap matches reality, flag any docs that reference removed or changed behavior.

## Problem

Chant's documentation includes extensive design for features that aren't yet implemented (daemon, notifications, approvals, cost tracking, Prometheus metrics, etc.). Without clear status labels, users and developers may:

1. Assume documented features are available
2. Try to use unimplemented commands
3. Spend time reading aspirational docs
4. Miss what's actually working today

## Solution

1. **Add status markers** to unimplemented feature documentation
   - "Status: Not Implemented ❌" with roadmap references
   - "Status: Partially Implemented ⚠️" for partially complete features
   - "Status: Implemented ✅" for complete features

2. **Fix outdated status claims** (e.g., export/reports.md was marked as "Planned" when it's fully implemented)

3. **Create a feature status index** that maps all documentation to implementation status

4. **Ensure consistency** between roadmap and documentation

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Added status headers to unimplemented feature docs:**
   - `docs/reference/notifications.md` - Not Implemented ❌
   - `docs/guides/approvals.md` - Not Implemented ❌
   - `docs/scale/daemon.md` - Not Implemented ❌
   - `docs/scale/metrics.md` - Not Implemented ❌
   - `docs/reference/costs.md` - Not Implemented ❌

2. **Added status to partially implemented features:**
   - `docs/scale/observability.md` - Partially Implemented ⚠️ (local/team tiers only)
   - `docs/scale/queue.md` - Partially Implemented ⚠️ (daemon-free only)
   - `docs/guides/ecosystem.md` - Partially Implemented ⚠️ (providers only)
   - `docs/reference/templates.md` - Partially Implemented ⚠️ (basic only)

3. **Fixed outdated status:**
   - `docs/reference/reports.md` - Changed from "Planned" to "Implemented ✅" (export feature is complete)

4. **Created comprehensive index:**
   - `docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md` - Maps all 40+ documented features to implementation status
   - Lists fully implemented features (30+)
   - Lists partial implementations (5)
   - Lists planned but not implemented (9+)
   - Includes command status reference
   - Provides roadmap timeline for planned features

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All unimplemented features clearly marked as "Status: Not Implemented ❌"
- [x] All partially implemented features marked as "Status: Partially Implemented ⚠️"
- [x] All implemented features confirmed in documentation
- [x] Export/reports.md status updated (was outdated)
- [x] FEATURE_STATUS.md created as comprehensive index
- [x] Status markers include Roadmap references for context
- [x] All changes verified (git status clean, tests pass, no lint errors)

## Notes

### What's Actually Implemented (v0.3.0)

The roadmap is accurate. Most Phase 0-5 features are complete:
- Core spec system ✅
- Git integration with worktrees ✅
- Multi-repo support ✅
- Autonomy features (drift, verify, replay) ✅
- MCP server with Claude/Ollama/OpenAI ✅
- Parallel execution with agent rotation ✅
- Export to JSON/CSV/Markdown ✅
- Interactive wizards ✅

### What's Not Implemented (Planned for v0.4.0+)

- Daemon mode (needs v0.5.0)
- Tantivy full-text search
- Prometheus metrics
- Notifications (webhooks/email/Slack)
- Approvals workflow
- Cost tracking
- Advanced template system (full Handlebars)
- Prompt registry/ecosystem

### Why This Matters

1. **User expectation management** - Clear status prevents frustration
2. **Development clarity** - Contributors know what's real vs aspirational
3. **Roadmap credibility** - Shows version timeline is realistic
4. **Documentation quality** - Readers understand stability vs plans
