# Create research-analysis prompt for extracting structured findings

Create the `research-analysis` prompt that guides agents to analyze data or code and extract structured findings.

## Context

Research-analysis specs process input data:

```yaml
---
type: research
prompt: research-analysis
origin:
  - data/metrics.csv
informed_by:
  - src/**/*.rs
target_files:
  - analysis/findings.md
  - analysis/schema.edn
---
```

The agent needs guidance to:
1. Process all input files systematically
2. Extract precise, structured information
3. Output in the requested format (markdown, EDN, JSON)
4. Be exhaustive, not summarizing

## Prompt Content

The prompt should include:

### Principles
- **Systematic** — Process all inputs methodically
- **Precise** — Extract exact details, not summaries
- **Structured** — Output in the requested format
- **Complete** — Don't skip edge cases

### Process
1. Read all files in `origin:` (data to analyze)
2. Read all files in `informed_by:` (context/reference)
3. Answer each Research Question with evidence
4. Produce output in `target_files:` format
5. Verify output against Acceptance Criteria

### Output Formats
- **EDN** — Use Clojure EDN syntax, include comments
- **JSON** — Valid JSON, pretty-printed
- **Markdown** — Structured with headers and tables

### For Schema Derivation (Wobble use case)
When deriving schema sections:
- Be exhaustive — capture every variant
- Be precise — use exact types, not "any"
- Include examples as comments
- Cross-reference other schema sections

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prompt file created at `.chant/prompts/research-analysis.md`
- [ ] Prompt explains systematic analysis process
- [ ] Prompt explains output format requirements
- [ ] Prompt includes guidance for schema derivation
- [ ] Prompt is clear and actionable
