# Create validation scripts for each example

Add `test-assertions.sh` to each example for output validation.

### Inherited Context

- Validation must verify semantic correctness, not just file existence
- Scripts should be runnable independently after example execution

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each of 5 examples has `test-assertions.sh` script
- [ ] Scripts check required output files exist
- [ ] Scripts validate key content in output files (semantic checks)
- [ ] Scripts exit 0 on pass, 1 on failure with descriptive error message
- [ ] Scripts are executable (chmod +x)

### Edge Cases

- Partial execution: Script should report which assertions passed/failed
- File content variations: Use flexible pattern matching (grep/regex) not exact string matches
- Missing output directory: Script should fail gracefully with clear message

### Example Test Cases

For each example, verify:
- approval-workflow: Check pull request markdown file exists and contains approval criteria
- kpi-okr-workflow: Verify OKR tracking document has quarterly targets
- tdd-workflow: Confirm test file exists and includes assertion patterns
- research-workflow: Validate summary markdown contains findings and sources
- oss-maintainer-workflow: Check release notes and issue triage files exist
