# Implement chant work --chain flag for autonomous workflows

Add --chain flag to 'chant work' that automatically works through ready specs:

chant work --chain
  → Works first ready spec
  → Upon completion, finds next ready spec
  → Continues until no more ready specs or failure

chant work --chain --label autonomous
  → Only chain through specs with 'autonomous' label

chant work --chain --max 5
  → Chain through maximum 5 specs then stop

Behavior:
- Respects dependencies (only works ready specs)
- Stops on first failure
- Can be interrupted with Ctrl+C
- Shows progress ("Working 3 of 8 ready specs")
- Compatible with --parallel (chain within each parallel worker)

Use cases:
- Autonomous batch processing
- Overnight work queues
- CI/CD pipelines
- Unattended spec execution
