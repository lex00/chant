# Create OSS maintainer workflow example with 6-phase fork-staging pattern

## Context

The OSS maintainer workflow guide describes a 6-phase research-driven bug fix process:
1. Comprehension - understand what the issue is about
2. Reproduction - create failing test or instructions
3. Root Cause - determine what needs to be fixed
4. Sprawl - expand view based on root cause
5. Fork Fix - implement fix + staging PR
6. Upstream PR - human gate before real PR

Create an example showing a simulated issue #42 (concurrent write data loss) through all 6 phases.

## Structure

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/README.md` explains the 6-phase workflow
- [ ] Phase 1 spec uses `target_files:` pointing to comprehension research output
- [ ] Phase 2 spec uses `informed_by:` referencing phase 1, `target_files:` for test file
- [ ] Phase 3 spec uses `informed_by:` referencing phases 1+2, `target_files:` for RCA output
- [ ] Phase 4 spec uses `informed_by:` referencing phase 3, `target_files:` for sprawl output
- [ ] Phase 5 spec uses `informed_by:` referencing phases 3+4 research outputs
- [ ] Phase 6 spec documents human gate pattern for upstream PR
- [ ] All 3 research outputs exist in `.chant/research/`
- [ ] `src/storage/store.py` contains sample code demonstrating the bug pattern
- [ ] `tests/regression/test_issue_42.py` contains a test that would fail without the fix
- [ ] Specs show proper `depends_on:` chain where appropriate
- [ ] `examples/README.md` updated to include oss-maintainer-workflow entry
