# Move approvals.md out of planned directory

The file `docs/roadmap/planned/approvals.md` claims "Spec Approval is fully implemented (v0.3.6)" but sits in the `/planned/` directory, which is confusing.

## Tasks

1. Read `docs/roadmap/planned/approvals.md` content
2. Determine best location (likely `docs/roadmap/completed/` or merge into `docs/guides/approval-workflow.md`)
3. Move or delete the file
4. Update `docs/SUMMARY.md` if it references this file
5. Verify no broken links

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No "implemented" features in `/roadmap/planned/` directory
- [ ] File moved to appropriate location or content merged elsewhere
- [ ] SUMMARY.md updated if needed
- [ ] No broken internal links
