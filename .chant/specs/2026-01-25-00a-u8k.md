# Fix spec 006 - make chant show work with archived specs

## Problem

Spec 006 was marked complete but `chant show` cannot find archived specs in subfolders.

When archived specs are stored in `.chant/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/` subdirectories, the `resolve_spec()` function fails to find them because:
1. `resolve_spec()` calls `load_all_specs(specs_dir)` where `specs_dir` is `.chant/specs/`
2. It does not search `.chant/archive/` directory
3. Archived specs remain unfindable via CLI commands

**Current behavior**: `chant show 2026-01-24-001-cxn` returns `Error: Spec not found`
**Expected behavior**: Should find the spec in `.chant/archive/2026-01-24/2026-01-24-001-cxn.md`

## Solution

Modify `resolve_spec()` to search both:
1. Active specs in `.chant/specs/`
2. Archived specs in `.chant/archive/`

This ensures all CLI commands that use `resolve_spec()` (show, work --force, etc.) work with both active and archived specs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `resolve_spec()` loads specs from both specs and archive directories
- [ ] `chant show <archived-spec-id>` successfully finds and displays archived specs
- [ ] `chant work --force <archived-spec-id>` can re-run archived specs
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New test verifies archived spec lookup works
