# Create built-in verify prompt template

Add the built-in `verify.md` prompt template that instructs the agent how to verify acceptance criteria. This prompt should be embedded in the binary or loaded from a default location, similar to how other built-in prompts are handled.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `.chant/prompts/verify.md` template created with verification instructions
- [ ] Prompt explains PASS/FAIL/SKIP reporting format clearly
- [ ] Output format section includes example verification summary with checkboxes
- [ ] Prompt is concise (< 300 words) to minimize token usage
- [ ] Template integrated with prompt loading system (follows existing prompt patterns)

### Edge Cases

- Agent cannot determine a criterion's status: Prompt should instruct to use SKIP with explanation
- Criterion is ambiguous or subjective: Prompt should guide agent to document assumptions
- Multiple interpretations possible: Prompt should instruct to report most conservative result

### Example Test Cases

For this feature, verify:
- Prompt file exists and is readable
- Prompt loading mechanism finds verify prompt by name
- Prompt content includes all required sections (task, output format, criteria reporting)
