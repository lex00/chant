# Add GitHub Actions CI for build and tests

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Rust project and runs tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] Trigger on push to main and pull requests
- [ ] Run on ubuntu-latest
- [ ] Install Rust toolchain
- [ ] Run `cargo build`
- [ ] Run `cargo test`
- [ ] Run `cargo clippy` for linting
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt --check` for formatting

## Implementation Notes

- Use `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` action
- Cache cargo dependencies for faster builds
- Run clippy with `-D warnings` to fail on warnings
