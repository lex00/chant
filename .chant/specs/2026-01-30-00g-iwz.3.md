# Brief Output Formatter

Implement a formatter that takes `StatusData` and produces a single-line summary suitable for status bars and scripts.

### Inherited Context

- Output must be concise (single line, <80 chars)
- Follow existing CLI formatting patterns

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Formatter outputs format: "chant: X done, Y running, Z ready, W failed"
- [x] Omit sections with 0 count (e.g., if 0 failed, omit "0 failed")
- [x] Single line with no newlines
- [x] Order: done, running, ready, failed

### Edge Cases

- All counts 0: Output "chant: no specs"
- Only completed specs: Output "chant: X done"
- Mix of statuses: Include all non-zero counts

### Example Test Cases

- Given 45 completed, 3 in_progress, 8 ready, 1 failed: "chant: 45 done, 3 running, 8 ready, 1 failed"
- Given 10 completed, 0 others: "chant: 10 done"
- Given 0 specs: "chant: no specs"
