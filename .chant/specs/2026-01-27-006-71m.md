# Clarify in CLAUDE.md that agents must not use Task tool to parallelize spec execution - chant handles multi-spec orchestration via chant work --parallel. Agents CAN still use Task for search/explore within a single spec. Add to constraints section with clear examples of what is and isnt allowed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add new "Task Tool for Multi-Spec Parallelization" subsection under "What NOT to do" in Important Constraints section
- [x] Include clear ❌ examples of what is NOT allowed (using Task to parallelize specs)
- [x] Include "Why?" explanation pointing to chant's built-in --parallel feature
- [x] Include "What IS allowed - Task tool within a single spec" subsection
- [x] Include clear ✅ examples of what IS allowed (search/explore within a single spec)
- [x] Provide examples of WRONG pattern (Task to parallelize specs)
- [x] Provide examples of RIGHT pattern (using chant work --parallel)
- [x] Provide examples of RIGHT pattern (using Task for search within a spec)
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code formatted with cargo fmt
- [x] No lint errors from cargo clippy
