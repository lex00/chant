# Diagnose and fix chant list performance issue

## Problem

`chant list` is very slow in this repo (~0.867 seconds) but fast in other repos. 

**Observed:**
- This repo: 11 active specs, 355 archived specs, 840 commits
- Takes ~0.9 seconds to list 11 specs
- Other repos: instant

**Suspect causes:**
1. Loading archived specs unnecessarily (355 specs in .chant/archive/)
2. Git operations per spec (author lookup, activity time)
3. Something in this specific repo's git history

## Investigation Needed

1. **Profile chant list:**
   - Add timing logs to identify slow operations
   - Check if archive is being loaded
   - Check git operation count

2. **Compare with fast repo:**
   - What's different?
   - Fewer commits? Fewer archived specs?

3. **Check if archive is scanned:**
   - `load_all_specs` uses `load_specs_recursive`
   - Does it recurse into archive?
   - Should list even touch archive?

4. **Check author/activity lookups:**
   - List shows: `👤 lex00 ↩ 1h`
   - Does this require git operations per spec?
   - Can it be cached or batched?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Identify root cause of slowdown
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Verify `chant list` is fast (<0.1s for 11 specs)
- [ ] Add tests if needed
- [ ] All tests passing
