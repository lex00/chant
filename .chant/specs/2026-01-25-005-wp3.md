# Add GitHub Actions CI workflow for releases

## Overview

Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automated releases.

## Workflows to Create

### 1. CI Workflow (ci.yml)
Runs on every push and PR:
- [ ] Build on Linux, macOS, Windows
- [ ] Run tests (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Run linter (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] Check formatting (`cargo fmt -- --check`)

### 2. Release Workflow (release.yml)
Runs on tag push (v*):
- [ ] Build release binaries for:
  - [ ] Linux x86_64 (musl for static linking)
  - [ ] macOS x86_64
  - [ ] macOS aarch64 (Apple Silicon)
  - [ ] Windows x86_64
- [ ] Create GitHub Release with binaries attached
- [ ] Generate release notes from CHANGELOG.md

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists and runs on push/PR
- [ ] CI checks: build, test, clippy, fmt
- [ ] `.github/workflows/release.yml` exists and runs on version tags
- [ ] Release builds binaries for Linux, macOS (both archs), Windows
- [ ] Release creates GitHub Release with attached binaries
- [ ] Binaries are named clearly (e.g., `chant-v0.1.0-linux-x86_64`)
