# Add GitHub Actions CI workflow for releases

## Overview

Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automated releases.

## Workflows to Create

### 1. CI Workflow (ci.yml)
Runs on every push and PR:
- [x] Build on Linux, macOS, Windows
- [x] Run tests (`cargo test`)
- [x] Run linter (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [x] Check formatting (`cargo fmt -- --check`)

### 2. Release Workflow (release.yml)
Runs on tag push (v*):
- [x] Build release binaries for:
  - [x] Linux x86_64 (musl for static linking)
  - [x] macOS x86_64
  - [x] macOS aarch64 (Apple Silicon)
  - [x] Windows x86_64
- [x] Create GitHub Release with binaries attached
- [x] Generate release notes from CHANGELOG.md

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists and runs on push/PR
- [x] CI checks: build, test, clippy, fmt
- [x] `.github/workflows/release.yml` exists and runs on version tags
- [x] Release builds binaries for Linux, macOS (both archs), Windows
- [x] Release creates GitHub Release with attached binaries
- [x] Binaries are named clearly (e.g., `chant-v0.1.0-linux-x86_64`)
