# Enterprise KPI/OKR workflow - Complete multi-page walkthrough with concrete artifacts

## Problem

Enterprise teams need a concrete, realistic example showing how to use chant for KPI/OKR tracking. The documentation should be:
- **Abstract example**: Fictional company, not based on the chant repo itself
- **Multi-page walkthrough**: Day-by-day progression through all phases
- **Concrete artifacts**: Actual markdown files, spec frontmatter, command outputs
- **One specific KPI**: Focus on single measurable goal (e.g., "Reduce Q1 churn from 8% to 5%")

Currently, enterprise docs focus on features but lack end-to-end workflow examples.

## Solution

Create a multi-page guide in `docs/guides/enterprise/kpi-okr/` showing a complete KPI tracking workflow for **Acme SaaS Corp** reducing customer churn.

### Scenario: Acme SaaS Corp
- **Company**: B2B SaaS platform with 5,000 customers
- **Q1 OKR**: Reduce customer churn from 8% to 5%
- **Team**: Product VP (Sarah), Data Analyst (Mike), Engineers (managed by chant)
- **Timeline**: 4-week sprint

### Multi-Page Structure

**`README.md`** - Overview and navigation
- The Acme Corp scenario
- KPI definition: Reduce churn 8% → 5%
- Workflow phases diagram
- Links to each phase

**`01-scenario.md`** - The Business Context
- Acme's product and customer base
- Current churn rate analysis
- Q1 OKR definition and success metrics
- Team structure and roles

**`02-data-ingestion.md`** - Week 1: Human Investigation Phase
- Mike (analyst) reviews Datadog metrics, Zendesk tickets, user surveys
- Creates markdown digests in `.chant/context/kpi-churn-q1/`
- Concrete artifacts:
  - `datadog-churn-metrics-2026-01.md` (actual file content)
  - `zendesk-support-patterns.md` (actual file content)
  - `user-survey-summary.md` (actual file content)
- Commands run: None yet (human phase)

**`03-research.md`** - Week 2: Chant Investigation Phase
- Sarah creates research spec: `chant add --type research "Analyze Q1 churn drivers"`
- Chant agent reads digested docs, identifies patterns
- Concrete artifacts:
  - Research spec frontmatter (full YAML)
  - Research spec body with findings (actual markdown)
  - Command: `chant work 2026-01-28-001-xyz`
  - Agent output showing analysis

**`04-approval.md`** - Week 2: Human Approval Gate
- Sarah and team review research findings
- Discussion in approval section
- Concrete artifacts:
  - `chant reject` with reason (command + output)
  - Agent refines analysis with additional context
  - `chant approve --by sarah` (command + updated spec)
  - Full spec with approval discussion thread

**`05-implementation.md`** - Week 3: Auto-Generation & Execution
- Approved research triggers implementation planning
- Chant converts research → driver spec with members
- Concrete artifacts:
  - Driver spec frontmatter with `members:` array
  - Member specs: `001-xyz-1-onboarding-wizard.md`, `001-xyz-2-email-sequence.md`, etc.
  - Commands: `chant work --parallel --label kpi-churn`
  - Parallel execution output
  - `chant merge --all-completed` output

**`06-reporting.md`** - Daily Updates & Dashboard
- Cron job setup for daily KPI tracking
- Activity feed → dashboard updates
- Concrete artifacts:
  - Cron configuration file
  - `chant activity --since 1d` output
  - Dashboard generation script
  - Example daily report (Slack message or email)
  - Weekly progress chart

**`artifacts/`** - All Example Files
- Full content of all digested data files
- Complete spec files (frontmatter + body)
- Shell scripts for automation
- Configuration files

### Style Guidelines
- **High-level abstract overview** - Not a detailed tutorial, just enough to show it's real
- Use realistic but fictional data (customer counts, churn percentages, ticket IDs)
- Show key command examples, not exhaustive outputs
- Include just enough artifacts to demonstrate the pattern (not every file)
- Focus on workflow flow, not implementation details
- Balance: Concrete enough to be believable, abstract enough to stay high-level
