# Fix documentation accuracy and redundancy issues from audit

Documentation audit revealed accuracy issues, outdated examples, and redundant content that needs fixing.

## Context

Audit compared docs against implementation in `src/worktree.rs`, `src/spec.rs`, `src/config.rs` and found:
- Wrong paths documented
- Features described as implemented that aren't
- Redundant content across multiple docs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Accuracy Fixes (Priority 1)

- [x] **Fix worktree path**: Update all references from `.chant/.worktrees/{spec-id}/` to `/tmp/chant-{spec-id}` in:
  - `docs/scale/isolation.md` - rewrote entire file with correct paths
  - `docs/concepts/lifecycle.md` - updated data flow diagram

- [x] **Remove shallow clone as "recommended"**: In `docs/scale/isolation.md`:
  - Marked as "Alternative approach (not implemented)"
  - Removed "Recommended" label
  - Added note that worktree+branch is the actual implementation
  - Removed "Research needed" note

- [x] **Remove unimplemented frontmatter fields** from `docs/scale/queue.md`:
  - Removed `started_by` and `started_at` examples

- [x] **Mark priority field as unimplemented**:
  - `docs/scale/queue.md` - added "Status: Not Implemented" note

- [x] **Mark pools as unimplemented**: In `docs/scale/scale.md`:
  - Added "Status: Not Implemented" header with roadmap reference

### Redundancy Fixes (Priority 2)

- [x] **Consolidate prompts docs**:
  - Simplified `docs/concepts/prompts.md` to brief overview
  - Added implementation note to `docs/guides/prompts.md` about unimplemented Handlebars features
  - Removed duplicate template variable tables and hooks documentation

- [x] **Consolidate spec lifecycle content**:
  - `docs/concepts/specs.md` now references `lifecycle.md` instead of duplicating statuses

- [x] **Dedupe frontmatter schema**:
  - Added cross-reference from `specs.md` to `schema.md` for validation details

### Status Badges (Priority 3)

- [x] Add "Status: Not Implemented" badges to unimplemented features in:
  - `docs/scale/scale.md` (daemon, pools, metrics, lock API, queue, deployment patterns)
  - `docs/scale/queue.md` (priority, multi-daemon)
  - `docs/scale/isolation.md` (shallow clone, sparse checkout, worktree pool)

## Notes

- Did NOT delete content about planned features - marked clearly as unimplemented
- FEATURE_STATUS.md already correctly tracks these - docs now consistent with it
- Removed "Research needed" note from isolation.md since worktrees are the implementation
