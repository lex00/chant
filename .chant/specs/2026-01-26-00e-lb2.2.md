# Add frontmatter fields for verification tracking

Extend the spec frontmatter schema to include `last_verified`, `verification_status`, and `verification_failures` fields. Update the `Spec` struct and parsing logic to handle these optional fields, with backward compatibility for existing specs that lack them.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `Spec` struct has `last_verified: Option<DateTime>`, `verification_status: Option<String>`, `verification_failures: Option<Vec<String>>` fields
- [ ] Frontmatter parser reads and writes these fields correctly
- [ ] Existing specs without these fields parse successfully (fields default to None)
- [ ] `just test` passes with new field handling
- [ ] `just lint` passes with no warnings

### Edge Cases

- Spec with only `last_verified` set: Other fields should be None
- Spec with `verification_failures` as empty array: Should parse as Some(vec![]) not None
- Invalid datetime format in `last_verified`: Should produce a clear parse error
- Malformed `verification_failures` (not an array): Should produce a clear parse error

### Example Test Cases

For this feature, verify:
- Parse spec with all verification fields present
- Parse spec with no verification fields (legacy spec)
- Parse spec with partial verification fields
- Write spec and verify frontmatter includes verification fields when set
