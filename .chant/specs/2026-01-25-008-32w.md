# Investigate why 006 was prematurely marked complete

## Problem

Spec 006 (archive folder organization) was marked as completed by the agent, but it appears the work may have been incomplete or premature.

## Investigation Questions

1. **What was the completion criteria?**
   - Review the acceptance criteria in the spec
   - Were all criteria actually met?

2. **What triggered the completion?**
   - Did the agent mark it complete manually?
   - Did finalize_spec() run?
   - Was there a commit with the spec ID?

3. **What was missing or incomplete?**
   - Review the git diff for the spec
   - Check if all acceptance criteria checkboxes were validated
   - Were there untested edge cases?

4. **Root cause analysis**
   - Is this a problem with the standard prompt?
   - Is this a problem with finalize_spec() validation?
   - Should acceptance criteria be automatically validated?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document what was incomplete about 006
- [ ] Identify root cause of premature completion
- [ ] Recommend fix (prompt change, code change, or both)
- [ ] Create follow-up spec if code changes needed
