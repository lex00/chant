# Implement --parallel flag for concurrent spec execution

Add a `--parallel` flag to `chant work` that executes all ready specs concurrently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `--parallel` flag to work command
- [x] When used without spec ID, execute all ready specs in parallel
- [x] Spawn multiple agent processes concurrently
- [x] Stream output from all agents (prefixed with spec ID)
- [x] Wait for all agents to complete
- [x] Report summary of results (passed/failed counts)
- [x] Update docs/reference/cli.md with examples

## Example Usage

```bash
# Execute all ready specs in parallel
chant work --parallel

# Execute specific spec (normal behavior, --parallel ignored)
chant work 001

# Combine with label filter
chant work --parallel --label auth
```

## Example Output

```
→ Starting 3 specs in parallel...

Summary: 3 completed, 0 failed
```

## Implementation Notes

- Use `std::thread::spawn` or `tokio` for concurrency
- Each agent runs in its own process via `invoke_agent`
- Collect output streams and prefix with spec ID
- Handle failures gracefully (one failure shouldn't stop others)
- Consider adding `--max-parallel N` to limit concurrency
