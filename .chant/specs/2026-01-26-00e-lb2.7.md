# Add verification output formatting and exit code support

Implement the terminal output that displays verification results in a human-readable format, showing pass/fail status for each criterion and an overall summary. Support `--exit-code` flag to return non-zero exit code if any verification fails.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Verification output shows spec ID and title
- [ ] Each acceptance criterion displayed with ✓ (pass), ✗ (fail), or ~ (skip) icon
- [ ] Failure reasons displayed for FAIL criteria
- [ ] Overall verification result displayed (VERIFIED or FAILED)
- [ ] `--exit-code` flag returns exit code 1 if any spec verification fails, 0 if all pass

### Edge Cases

- Very long failure reasons: Should wrap or truncate gracefully
- Many criteria (>10): Should display all without pagination
- Multiple specs verified: Should show summary count (e.g., "5 passed, 2 failed")
- No criteria in spec: Should display "No criteria to verify"

### Example Test Cases

For this feature, verify:
- Single spec PASS shows green ✓ for all criteria and "VERIFIED" summary
- Single spec FAIL shows red ✗ for failed criteria and "FAILED" summary
- Multiple specs show summary: "Verified 3 specs: 2 passed, 1 failed"
- `--exit-code` returns 0 when all pass, 1 when any fail
