# Audit and remove docs for unimplemented scale/enterprise/planned features

## Context

Chant is nearing complete feature set. Documentation for unimplemented/planned features should be removed to avoid user confusion.

## Directories to Evaluate

| Directory | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `docs/scale/` | Remove (daemon, queue, observability - all unimplemented) |
| `docs/enterprise/` | Remove unimplemented, keep silent mode if implemented |
| `docs/roadmap/` | Remove entirely (planned features) |
| `docs/planning/` | Remove or move to repo wiki (internal planning) |
| `docs/guides/enterprise/` | KEEP - these are workflow guides using current features |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove `docs/scale/` directory (4 files)
- [x] Remove `docs/roadmap/` directory
- [x] Remove `docs/planning/` directory
- [x] Evaluate `docs/enterprise/` - keep only implemented features
- [x] Update `docs/SUMMARY.md` to remove deleted sections
- [x] Update `docs/README.md` to remove references
- [x] Rename `docs/guides/enterprise/` to `docs/guides/workflows/` to avoid confusion
- [x] Run `scripts/test-docs.sh` to verify no broken links
