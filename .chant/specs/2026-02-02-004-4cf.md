# Fix OSS maintainer workflow guide issues from audit

## Output

## Audit Findings

### Accuracy Issues
1. `02-reproduction.md:29-36` - Diagram shows "Triage Result" should be "Comprehension Output"
2. `02-reproduction.md:56` - `informed_by` example references triage spec, should be comprehension
3. `03-root-cause.md:429` - Dead link to deleted `08-advanced.md`
4. `05-fork-fix.md:125-129` - Wrong gh CLI syntax: `--base yourusername:main` doesn't work

### Naivety Issues
5. No "Quick Path" for simple fixes - 3 research phases is overkill for typos
6. No early exit guidance for "not a bug" / "won't fix"
7. Unclear who creates staging PR (agent can't auth to GitHub without setup)

## Files to Modify

- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/02-reproduction.md`
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/03-root-cause.md`
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/05-fork-fix.md`
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/index.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `02-reproduction.md` diagram (lines 29-36) says "Comprehension Output" not "Triage Result"
- [x] `02-reproduction.md` informed_by example (line 56) references comprehension spec not triage
- [x] `03-root-cause.md` link to `08-advanced.md` removed or replaced (line 429)
- [x] `05-fork-fix.md` gh CLI example uses correct syntax: `gh pr create --repo user/repo --base main --head user:branch`
- [x] `index.md` includes "Quick Path" section for simple fixes (skip sprawl for trivial bugs)
- [x] `index.md` or `01-comprehension.md` includes early exit guidance for "not a bug" decisions
- [x] `05-fork-fix.md` clarifies human creates staging PR (or documents agent auth requirements)
