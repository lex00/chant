# Fix OSS maintainer workflow guide issues from audit

## Output

## Audit Findings

### Accuracy Issues
1. `02-reproduction.md:29-36` - Diagram shows "Triage Result" should be "Comprehension Output"
2. `02-reproduction.md:56` - `informed_by` example references triage spec, should be comprehension
3. `03-root-cause.md:429` - Dead link to deleted `08-advanced.md`
4. `05-fork-fix.md:125-129` - Wrong gh CLI syntax: `--base yourusername:main` doesn't work

### Naivety Issues
5. No "Quick Path" for simple fixes - 3 research phases is overkill for typos
6. No early exit guidance for "not a bug" / "won't fix"
7. Unclear who creates staging PR (agent can't auth to GitHub without setup)

## Files to Modify

- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/02-reproduction.md`
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/03-root-cause.md`
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/05-fork-fix.md`
- `docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/index.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `02-reproduction.md` diagram (lines 29-36) says "Comprehension Output" not "Triage Result"
- [x] `02-reproduction.md` informed_by example (line 56) references comprehension spec not triage
- [x] `03-root-cause.md` link to `08-advanced.md` removed or replaced (line 429)
- [x] `05-fork-fix.md` gh CLI example uses correct syntax: `gh pr create --repo user/repo --base main --head user:branch`
- [x] `index.md` includes "Quick Path" section for simple fixes (skip sprawl for trivial bugs)
- [x] `index.md` or `01-comprehension.md` includes early exit guidance for "not a bug" decisions
- [x] `05-fork-fix.md` clarifies human creates staging PR (or documents agent auth requirements)

I'll fix the OSS maintainer workflow guide issues found in the audit. Let me start by reading the relevant files.
Now I'll fix the identified issues:
Now I'll update the spec with checked-off criteria:
## Summary

Fixed all 7 issues from the OSS maintainer workflow guide audit.

**Accuracy fixes:**
- Updated diagram in `02-reproduction.md` to show "Comprehension Output" instead of "Triage Result"
- Changed `informed_by` example to reference comprehension spec
- Removed dead link to deleted `08-advanced.md`
- Fixed `gh pr create` syntax to use correct flags

**Naivety fixes:**
- Added "Quick Path" section in `index.md` for simple fixes (typos, one-line changes)
- Added early exit guidance for "not a bug" / "won't fix" scenarios
- Clarified in `05-fork-fix.md` that human creates staging PR with note about agent authentication requirements```
