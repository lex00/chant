# Add depends_on field with dependency checking

Prevent `chant work` from executing specs that have unsatisfied dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] In `cmd_work`, check if spec has depends_on with incomplete dependencies
- [ ] If dependencies are not satisfied, print error listing the blocking specs
- [ ] Do not execute the spec if dependencies are unsatisfied
- [ ] The depends_on frontmatter field already exists in spec.rs

## Implementation Notes

- Use `spec.is_ready(&all_specs)` to check if dependencies are satisfied
- If not ready, list which specs are blocking
- Print a helpful message like "Blocked by: spec-id-1, spec-id-2"
