# Add integration test for spec finalization

Create a test that verifies:
- After successful agent completion, spec is marked completed
- All fields (status, commits, completed_at) are properly set
- The spec file is actually saved
- Finalization handles commit detection failures gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement as described
- [ ] All tests pass
