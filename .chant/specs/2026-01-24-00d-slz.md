# Add GitHub Actions CI to build documentation

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the mdbook documentation on push and PR.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
- [x] Trigger on push to main and pull requests
- [x] Install mdbook
- [x] Build docs with `mdbook build docs`
- [x] Upload built docs as artifact
- [x] Optionally deploy to GitHub Pages on main branch pushes

## Implementation Notes

- Use `peaceiris/actions-mdbook` or install mdbook via cargo
- The docs are in the `docs/` directory
- Output goes to `docs/book/`
