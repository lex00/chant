# Add GitHub Actions CI to build documentation

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the mdbook documentation on push and PR.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
- [x] Trigger on push to main and pull requests
- [x] Install mdbook
- [x] Build docs with `mdbook build docs`
- [x] Upload built docs as artifact
- [x] Optionally deploy to GitHub Pages on main branch pushes

## Implementation Notes

- Use `peaceiris/actions-mdbook` or install mdbook via cargo
- The docs are in the `docs/` directory
- Output goes to `docs/book/`

## Agent Output

2026-01-24T12:28:34Z

```
The spec is complete. The `.github/workflows/docs.yml` file was already fully implemented with:

- **Triggers**: Push to main branch and pull requests to main
- **mdbook installation**: Uses `peaceiris/actions-mdbook@v2` 
- **Build**: Runs `mdbook build docs`
- **Artifact upload**: Uploads `docs/book` as an artifact named "docs"
- **GitHub Pages deployment**: Conditionally deploys on main branch pushes using `actions/deploy-pages@v4`

All acceptance criteria have been checked off and the commit has been made.```
