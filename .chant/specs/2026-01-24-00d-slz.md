# Add GitHub Actions CI to build documentation

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the mdbook documentation on push and PR.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
- [ ] Trigger on push to main and pull requests
- [ ] Install mdbook
- [ ] Build docs with `mdbook build docs`
- [ ] Upload built docs as artifact
- [ ] Optionally deploy to GitHub Pages on main branch pushes

## Implementation Notes

- Use `peaceiris/actions-mdbook` or install mdbook via cargo
- The docs are in the `docs/` directory
- Output goes to `docs/book/`
