# Integrate Scoring into chant lint

Add quality scoring display to the `chant lint` command.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Call scoring functions for each spec in `chant lint`
- [x] Display format: `{spec_id}: {traffic_light} | Complexity: {grade} | Confidence: {grade} | Splittable: {grade}`
- [x] Show suggestions below specs with Review/Refine status
- [x] Support `--verbose` flag to show all dimension details including isolation and AC quality
- [x] Ensure lint output remains readable with new quality info

### Edge Cases

- Long suggestion lists should be truncated with "... and N more"
- Empty spec list should not crash

### Example Test Cases

- Running `chant lint` on 3 specs shows traffic light and grades for each
- Spec with Grade D shows red refine status and suggestion
- `chant lint --verbose` shows all 5 dimensions

### Requires
