# Make approval-workflow specs all require approval to prevent accidental execution

## Problem

Running tests executes `002-approved-feature` because it has approval.status=approved, creating real files in the example directory. Examples should be static demonstrations.

## Solution

Add `approval.required: true` with `approval.status: pending` to 002-approved-feature so it won't execute during tests, while still demonstrating the approved state in comments/docs.

Or alternatively, mark spec status as `completed` to skip execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Running `./test-examples.sh approval-workflow` does not create new files
- [x] All 3 specs in approval-workflow show as expected failures (require approval or rejected)
- [x] Example structure remains intact as a demonstration
- [x] Clean up any generated files from previous runs
