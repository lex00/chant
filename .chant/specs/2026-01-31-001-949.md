# Condense implementation mismatch warnings on archive

## Problem

When archiving specs, lint shows many individual "target_files mismatch" warnings which creates noise:
```
⚠ spec-1: target_files mismatch...
⚠ spec-2: target_files mismatch...
... (68 more)
```

## Solution

Condense repeated warning types into summary counts:
```
⚠ Prediction mismatch (target_files) - implementation is fine: 68 specs
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Group identical warning types when count > 3
- [x] Show condensed format: `{warning-type}: {count} specs`
- [x] Still show individual warnings when count ≤ 3
- [x] Apply to archive command output
model: sonnet-4.5

## Agent Output

2026-01-31T21:30:02Z

```
I'll implement the spec to condense implementation mismatch warnings on archive.
## Summary

Modified src/cmd/lifecycle.rs:1671-1679 to condense repeated implementation mismatch warnings.

- Added `print_condensed_warnings()` function that groups warnings by type
- Shows condensed format `⚠ {warning-type}: {count} specs` when count > 3
- Displays individual warnings with full details when count ≤ 3
- Replaced loop that printed each warning with call to new condensation function

All tests pass, code formatted and linted successfully.```
