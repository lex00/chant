# Condense implementation mismatch warnings on archive

## Problem

When archiving specs, lint shows many individual "target_files mismatch" warnings which creates noise:
```
⚠ spec-1: target_files mismatch...
⚠ spec-2: target_files mismatch...
... (68 more)
```

## Solution

Condense repeated warning types into summary counts:
```
⚠ Prediction mismatch (target_files) - implementation is fine: 68 specs
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Group identical warning types when count > 3
- [x] Show condensed format: `{warning-type}: {count} specs`
- [x] Still show individual warnings when count ≤ 3
- [x] Apply to archive command output
