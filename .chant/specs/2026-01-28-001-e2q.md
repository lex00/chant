# Comprehensive documentation audit - remove unimplemented features

## Problem

Front-facing user documentation currently describes features that are not yet implemented. This creates confusion for users who expect these features to work. According to FEATURE_STATUS.md, several features are marked as "Planned but Not Implemented ❌" but may still be described as available in user-facing docs.

**Principle**: Only the roadmap should reference unimplemented features. All other documentation should describe what exists today.

## Unimplemented Features to Check

From FEATURE_STATUS.md, these features should ONLY be mentioned in roadmap.md:

### Fully Unimplemented ❌
- Hooks (docs/concepts/hooks.md)
- Triggers (docs/concepts/triggers.md)
- Notifications (docs/reference/notifications.md)
- Approvals (docs/guides/approvals.md)
- Daemon Mode (docs/scale/daemon.md)
- Prometheus Metrics (docs/scale/metrics.md)
- Cost Tracking (docs/reference/costs.md)
- Tantivy Search (advanced search in docs/reference/search.md)
- DAG Visualization (docs/scale/observability.md)
- Prompt Registry (docs/guides/ecosystem.md)
- Edit Command (docs/reference/cli.md)

### Commands Not Implemented ❌
- `chant daemon`
- `chant daemon start`
- `chant daemon stop`
- `chant queue`
- `chant edit`
- `chant lock`
- `chant agent worker`
- `chant notify`
- `chant approve`
- `chant costs`

### Partially Implemented ⚠️
- Templates: Only basic substitution (not full Handlebars)
- Queue Architecture: Only daemon-free (no Tantivy/PostgreSQL/Redis)
- Observability: Only Local & Team tiers (no Scale tier metrics/daemon)
- Ecosystem: Only provider adapters (no prompt registry, package management)
- Git Hooks: Only basic validation (no advanced workflows)

## Documentation Files to Audit

### High Priority (User-Facing)
1. `README.md` - Main landing page
2. `docs/getting-started/*.md` - First experience
3. `docs/reference/cli.md` - Command reference
4. `docs/concepts/*.md` - Core concepts
5. `CLAUDE.md` - Agent instructions

### Medium Priority (Reference)
6. `docs/reference/*.md` - All reference docs
7. `docs/guides/*.md` - All guides
8. `docs/scale/*.md` - Scale tier docs

### Low Priority (Already Marked)
9. `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` - Should contain unimplemented features
10. `docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md` - Already accurate

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] README.md audited - no references to unimplemented features
- [x] docs/getting-started/*.md audited - only describes what exists
- [x] docs/reference/cli.md audited - only lists implemented commands
- [x] docs/concepts/hooks.md - clearly marked as unimplemented or moved to roadmap-only
- [x] docs/concepts/triggers.md - clearly marked as unimplemented or moved to roadmap-only
- [x] docs/reference/notifications.md - clearly marked as unimplemented or moved to roadmap-only
- [x] docs/guides/approvals.md - clearly marked as unimplemented or moved to roadmap-only
- [x] docs/scale/daemon.md - clearly marked as unimplemented or moved to roadmap-only
- [x] docs/scale/metrics.md - clearly marked as unimplemented or moved to roadmap-only
- [x] docs/reference/costs.md - clearly marked as unimplemented or moved to roadmap-only
- [x] docs/reference/search.md - Tantivy features marked as unimplemented
- [x] docs/scale/observability.md - DAG visualization marked as unimplemented
- [x] docs/guides/ecosystem.md - prompt registry marked as unimplemented
- [x] docs/reference/templates.md - full Handlebars marked as unimplemented
- [x] docs/scale/queue.md - advanced backends marked as unimplemented
- [x] docs/reference/git-hooks.md - advanced workflows marked as unimplemented
- [x] CLAUDE.md audited - no agent instructions for unimplemented features
- [x] All docs updated with clear "Status: Not Implemented" warnings where needed
- [x] Roadmap.md remains the source of truth for future features

## Audit Strategy

1. **Read each document** in the priority order above
2. **Search for mentions** of unimplemented features/commands
3. **Evaluate each mention**:
   - Is it describing the feature as available now? → Remove or mark as unimplemented
   - Is it in a "future" or "planned" section? → Move reference to roadmap.md
   - Is it in roadmap.md? → Keep as-is
4. **Update accordingly**:
   - Add "Status: Not Implemented ❌" banners at top of unimplemented feature docs
   - Remove how-to instructions for unavailable features
   - Update command lists to exclude unimplemented commands
   - Add "See roadmap for planned features" links where appropriate
