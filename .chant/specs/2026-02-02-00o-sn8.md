# Add standard prompt to oss-maintainer-workflow example

## Problem

002-reproduction spec failed with "Prompt not found: standard". The example needs additional prompts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/.chant/prompts/standard.md` exists
- [x] Any other missing prompts referenced by specs are added (reproduce, implement, etc.)
- [x] All 6 specs can load their prompts without "Prompt not found" errors

## Agent Output

```
I'll implement the spec to add the missing prompts to the oss-maintainer-workflow example.
## Summary

Added `standard.md` prompt to both `.chant/prompts/` and `examples/oss-maintainer-workflow/.chant/prompts/`.

- Created standard prompt template for code implementation tasks
- Specs 002, 005, and 006 in the example can now load the "standard" prompt
- Spec 001, 003, and 004 use "research" prompt (already exists)

All acceptance criteria met. Work committed.```
