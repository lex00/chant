# Clean up Cursor template: remove just references, make language-agnostic

The Cursor template (`.cursorrules`) has issues that make it unsuitable for general users:

1. References `just` commands - this is chant-developer specific, not for end users
2. Rust-specific workspace settings (clippy, rust-analyzer, rustfmt)
3. Assumes a specific tech stack

This template provides instructions FOR Cursor's AI assistant, not for humans. Clean it up to be language-agnostic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove all `just` command references, replace with direct `chant` commands
- [x] Remove Rust-specific workspace configuration section
- [x] Make "Code Quality" section language-agnostic (general principles, not specific tools)
- [x] Update Key Commands table to use `chant` directly instead of `just chant`
- [x] Keep focus on instructions for Cursor's AI (this is `.cursorrules`, not a human guide)

I'll help you clean up the Cursor template to make it language-agnostic and remove chant-developer specific references. Let me start by reading the current `.cursorrules` file and planning the approach.
Let me search for the Cursor template file - it might be named differently.
Let me check the templates directory since this is likely a template file.
Found it! The Cursor template is `agent-cursor.md` in the templates directory. Let me read it.
Good! I've read the file. Now let me plan the cleanup approach:

**Analysis:**
1. Lines 17-36: "Use `just` Commands" section needs to be replaced with direct `chant` commands
2. Lines 51-66: Rust-specific workspace configuration section needs to be removed
3. Lines 68-73: Code Quality section has Rust-specific tools, needs to be language-agnostic
4. Lines 129-142: Key Commands table uses `just chant` instead of direct `chant`
5. Various references to `just test`, `just lint`, `just fmt` throughout need updating

**Plan:**
- Replace all `just` wrapper commands with direct equivalents (e.g., `just test` → appropriate language-agnostic test command)
- Remove the entire "Workspace Configuration" section (lines 51-66)
- Rewrite "Code Quality" section with general principles
- Update "Key Commands" table to use `chant` directly
- Update all DO/DON'T sections to be language-agnostic
- Remove Rust-specific references in "During Implementation" and "After Completion"
Now let me start making the changes. I'll begin by replacing the "Use `just` Commands" section:
Now let me remove the Rust-specific workspace configuration section:
Now let me update the DO/DON'T section:
Now let me update the "Before Starting" section:
Now let me update the "Parallel Development with Merge Workflow" section:
Now let me update the Key Commands table:
Let me verify the changes by reading the updated file to ensure all acceptance criteria are met:
Perfect! Let me verify all acceptance criteria are met:

**Acceptance Criteria Review:**
- ✅ Remove all `just` command references, replace with direct `chant` commands - DONE
- ✅ Remove Rust-specific workspace configuration section - DONE (removed lines 51-66)
- ✅ Make "Code Quality" section language-agnostic - DONE (now focuses on general principles)
- ✅ Update Key Commands table to use `chant` directly instead of `just chant` - DONE
- ✅ Keep focus on instructions for Cursor's AI - YES (this is `.cursorrules`, not a human guide)

All criteria are satisfied! Now let me update the spec with checkmarks:
Now let me commit the changes with the proper message:
Perfect! I've successfully completed the spec. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up the Cursor template (`templates/agent-cursor.md`) to make it language-agnostic and remove chant-developer specific references:

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed `just` command references** - Replaced all `just` wrapper commands with direct `chant` commands and language-agnostic development commands (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test`)

2. **Removed Rust-specific workspace configuration** - Deleted the entire "Workspace Configuration" section (lines 51-66) that contained Rust-analyzer, clippy, and rustfmt settings

3. **Made Code Quality section language-agnostic** - Rewrote the section to focus on general principles rather than Rust-specific tools (formatting, linting, type checking, best practices)

4. **Updated Key Commands table** - Changed all commands from `just chant` to direct `chant` commands, and replaced language-specific commands with "Use project-specific" guidance

5. **Maintained focus on Cursor's AI** - Kept the template as instructions FOR Cursor's AI assistant, not human documentation

### Files Modified:
- `templates/agent-cursor.md` - Updated template
- `.chant/specs/2026-01-30-00b-7gr.md` - All acceptance criteria marked complete

### Commit:
- Created commit with message: `chant(2026-01-30-00b-7gr): Clean up Cursor template - remove just commands, make language-agnostic`
- Git status is clean with no uncommitted changes

All acceptance criteria have been met and the work is complete!```
