# Clean up Cursor template: remove just references, make language-agnostic

The Cursor template (`.cursorrules`) has issues that make it unsuitable for general users:

1. References `just` commands - this is chant-developer specific, not for end users
2. Rust-specific workspace settings (clippy, rust-analyzer, rustfmt)
3. Assumes a specific tech stack

This template provides instructions FOR Cursor's AI assistant, not for humans. Clean it up to be language-agnostic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove all `just` command references, replace with direct `chant` commands
- [x] Remove Rust-specific workspace configuration section
- [x] Make "Code Quality" section language-agnostic (general principles, not specific tools)
- [x] Update Key Commands table to use `chant` directly instead of `just chant`
- [x] Keep focus on instructions for Cursor's AI (this is `.cursorrules`, not a human guide)
