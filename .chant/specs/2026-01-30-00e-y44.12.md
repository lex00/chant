# Integrate Scoring into chant work

Add quality warning before starting work on low-quality specs.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Calculate quality score before agent starts work
- [x] If status is Refine (red), show warning with dimensions and suggestions
- [x] Prompt user: "Continue anyway? [y/N]"
- [x] Abort work if user declines
- [x] If status is Review (yellow), show info message but proceed automatically
- [x] Ready (green) status proceeds silently

### Edge Cases

- Non-interactive mode (CI) should respect a `--force` flag to skip prompts
- Warnings should be clear about which dimensions failed
- User input validation (y/yes/n/no case insensitive)

### Example Test Cases

- Starting work on Grade A spec proceeds immediately
- Starting work on Grade D spec shows warning and waits for confirmation
- User entering "n" aborts work and returns to CLI
- `chant work --force` on Grade D spec proceeds without prompt

### Requires

- Calls scoring functions from Members 2-8
