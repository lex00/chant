## Location
docs/guides/oss-maintainer-workflow/08-advanced.md

## Content to Add

### Pausing Work
- `chant pause <spec-id>` - Stop running agent, set status to paused
- When to use: Need human decision, blocked on external info, taking a break
- Resume with `chant work <spec-id>` or `chant resume <spec-id>`
- Example: Pausing research spec when you need maintainer input

### Taking Over Work  
- `chant takeover <spec-id>` - Pause + analyze log + update spec for manual continuation
- When to use: Agent going wrong direction, need human guidance
- MCP: `chant_takeover` tool available for agent-to-agent handoff
- Example: Taking over a stuck implementation spec

- [x] Add "Taking Over Work" section with usage and example
