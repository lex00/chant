# Add interactive wizard mode to chant export command - choose format and filters

## Overview

When `chant export` is run without flags, launch an interactive wizard to configure export options.

## Interface

```bash
chant export                           # Wizard mode
chant export --format csv --ready      # Direct mode (existing)
```

### Wizard Flow

```
? Export format:
› JSON
  CSV
  Markdown

? Filter by status:
  [ ] pending
  [x] ready
  [ ] in_progress
  [ ] completed
  [ ] blocked
› [No filter - all statuses]

? Filter by type:
› No filter
  code
  task
  driver
  documentation
  research

? Output destination:
› Print to stdout
  Save to file

Exporting 12 specs to JSON...
```

## Implementation

- Detect if running with no flags (wizard mode) vs with flags (direct mode)
- Use `dialoguer::Select` for format (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
- Use `dialoguer::MultiSelect` for status filter (include "all" option)
- Use `dialoguer::Select` for type filter (include "all" option)
- Use `dialoguer::Select` for output (stdout vs file)
- If file selected, use `dialoguer::Input` for filename
- Pass selections to existing export logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `chant export` (no args) launches wizard
- [ ] Wizard prompts for: format, status, type, output
- [ ] Multi-select for status filter with "all" option
- [ ] Direct mode flags still work unchanged
- [ ] Tests for wizard flow
- [ ] Documentation updated
