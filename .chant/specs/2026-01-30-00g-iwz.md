# Dashboard Command - CLI dashboard showing project metrics

## Problem

Users lack a quick overview of project status. Currently they must run multiple commands (`chant list`, `chant ready`, etc.) to understand the state of their specs.

## Solution

Add `chant dashboard` command that shows a summary view:
- Spec counts by status
- Recent activity
- Specs needing attention
- Ready queue

## Dashboard Output

```
Chant Dashboard - my-project
============================

Status Overview
---------------
  Completed:   45 specs
  In Progress:  3 specs
  Ready:        8 specs
  Blocked:      2 specs
  Failed:       1 spec

Today's Activity
----------------
  Completed: 5 specs
  Started:   3 specs
  Created:   2 specs

Needs Attention
---------------
  [FAILED]  00a-xyz  Auth migration (failed 2h ago)
  [STALE]   00b-abc  API refactor (no activity 3d)
  [BLOCKED] 00c-def  Waiting on: 00a-xyz

Ready Queue (8 specs)
---------------------
  00d-vao  Spec Templates [M]
  00e-y44  Complexity Scoring [S]
  00f-gqz  Cost Tracking [M]
  ...

In Progress (3 specs)
---------------------
  00g-iwz  Dashboard Command (5m elapsed) - agent: main
  00h-f77  Native Orchestrator (12m elapsed) - agent: worker1
  ...
```

## Flags

### `--json`
Output as JSON for tooling integration.

### `--watch`
Refresh every 5 seconds (like `watch` command).

### `--brief`
Compact single-line summary:
```
chant: 45 done, 3 running, 8 ready, 2 blocked, 1 failed
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `chant dashboard` command displays formatted status overview
- [ ] Status counts: completed, in_progress, ready, blocked, failed, pending
- [ ] Today's activity section with completed/started/created counts
- [ ] Needs attention section: failed specs, stale specs (configurable threshold), blocked specs
- [ ] Ready queue listing with complexity indicators
- [ ] In-progress listing with elapsed time and agent name
- [ ] `--json` flag for JSON output
- [ ] `--brief` flag for single-line summary
- [ ] `--watch` flag for continuous refresh (5s interval)
- [ ] Stale threshold configurable in config.md (default: 3 days)
- [ ] Respects terminal width for formatting
- [ ] Unit tests for dashboard data aggregation
