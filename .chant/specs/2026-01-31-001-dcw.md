# Make chant archive auto-commit by default

## Problem

`chant archive` stages files but doesn't commit because `--commit` defaults to false. Users must run `chant archive --commit` explicitly.

## Solution

Change `--commit` to default to true. Add `--no-commit` flag for those who want to skip.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Change `--commit` to default true (use `default_value = "true"`)
- [ ] Add `--no-commit` flag that sets commit to false
- [ ] Archive command auto-commits by default
