# Add chant lint command for spec validation

Add a `lint` command that validates all specs for common issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `Lint` subcommand to CLI
- [ ] Check that all specs have valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Check that all specs have a title (# heading)
- [ ] Check that depends_on references exist
- [ ] Report all issues found with spec ID and description
- [ ] Exit with code 1 if any issues found, 0 if all valid

## Example Output

```
