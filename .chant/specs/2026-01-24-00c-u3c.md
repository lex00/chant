# Add chant lint command for spec validation

Add a `lint` command that validates all specs for common issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `Lint` subcommand to CLI
- [x] Check that all specs have valid YAML frontmatter
- [x] Check that all specs have a title (# heading)
- [x] Check that depends_on references exist
- [x] Report all issues found with spec ID and description
- [x] Exit with code 1 if any issues found, 0 if all valid

## Example Output

```
