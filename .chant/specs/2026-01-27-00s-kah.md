# Change reconcile references to merge in help text

## Problem

**User Report:** "The output suggested using `chant reconcile` but that command doesn't exist - should be `chant merge`."

Error messages and help text reference a non-existent `chant reconcile` command, causing user confusion.

**Example Error:**
```
Error: Cannot fast-forward merge
Suggestion: Try running 'chant reconcile --rebase'
```

But `chant reconcile` doesn't exist - the correct command is `chant merge`.

## Solution

Find and replace all references to "reconcile" with "merge" in:
- Error messages
- Help text
- Code comments
- Documentation

**Search locations:**
```bash
git grep -n "reconcile" src/
```

Expected locations:
- src/cmd/lifecycle.rs: Error messages suggesting reconcile
- src/cmd/work.rs: Post-execution hints
- src/main.rs: CLI help text
- docs/: Documentation files

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search codebase for all "reconcile" references
- [ ] Replace error messages: "chant reconcile" → "chant merge"
- [ ] Update help text in CLI
- [ ] Update code comments
- [ ] Check docs/ for reconcile mentions
- [ ] Verify no broken command references remain
- [ ] Build succeeds: `cargo build`
- [ ] Help text correct: `chant --help` and `chant merge --help`
