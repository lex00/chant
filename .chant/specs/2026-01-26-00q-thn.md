# Research additional semantic linting rules

## Context

New linting rules were added to improve spec quality:
- **Complexity warnings**: specs with >5 criteria, >5 files, >500 words
- **Coupling warnings**: specs referencing other spec IDs
- **Model waste warnings**: opus/sonnet on simple specs
- **Config validation**: agent commands, prompts, parallel limits

## Research Questions

1. What other semantic issues in specs could be detected?
2. What config validation rules are missing?
3. What patterns indicate poor spec quality?
4. What rules would help enforce haiku-friendly specs?

## Areas to Investigate

### Spec Content
- Vague acceptance criteria (no measurable outcome)
- Missing acceptance criteria entirely
- Overly broad descriptions
- Missing target_files for code specs
- Conflicting instructions in description

### Spec Metadata
- Invalid status transitions
- Orphaned member specs (driver deleted)
- Stale in_progress specs (no recent activity)
- Duplicate target_files across pending specs

### Config Semantics
- Model name typos/invalid values
- Prompt template syntax errors
- Circular dependencies in config
- Missing required fields per spec type

### Cross-Spec Analysis
- Multiple specs targeting same files (potential conflicts)
- Dependency chains that are too deep
- Specs that should be grouped as driver

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document 5+ potential new linting rules
- [ ] Categorize by severity (error vs warning)
- [ ] Identify implementation complexity for each
- [ ] Recommend priority order for implementation
