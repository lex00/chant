# Replace parent terminology with driver in split command

The split command uses "parent" to refer to the driving spec. The correct terminology is "driver" - the spec that drives/orchestrates its subtasks.

## Changes

In `src/main.rs`, rename:
- `parent_id` → `driver_id`
- `parent_spec` → `driver_spec` (or just `driver`)
- Comments referencing "parent" → "driver"

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rename parent variables to driver in cmd_split
- [ ] Update comments to use driver terminology
- [ ] Update split prompt to use driver terminology
- [ ] All tests pass
