# Replace parent terminology with driver in split command

The split command uses "parent" to refer to the driving spec. The correct terminology is "driver" - the spec that drives/orchestrates its subtasks.

## Changes

In `src/main.rs`, rename:
- `parent_id` → `driver_id`
- `parent_spec` → `driver_spec` (or just `driver`)
- Comments referencing "parent" → "driver"

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rename parent variables to driver in cmd_split
- [x] Update comments to use driver terminology
- [x] Update split prompt to use driver terminology
- [x] All tests pass
