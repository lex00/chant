# Simplify archive - remove include-members flag, always archive whole group

## Problem

The `--include-members` flag is unnecessary complexity. The behavior should be simple:

1. A driver spec can ONLY be archived if ALL its members are completed
2. Archiving a driver ALWAYS archives all its members automatically
3. No flag needed - this is the only sensible behavior

## Changes

1. Remove `--include-members` flag from Archive command
2. When archiving a driver:
   - Check all members are completed (fail if not)
   - Automatically include all members in the archive operation
3. When archiving a member directly:
   - Just archive that member (don't require driver)
   - Driver can stay if other members still active

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove `--include-members` flag from CLI
- [x] Remove `include_members` parameter from `cmd_archive()`
- [x] Archiving a driver automatically archives all completed members
- [x] Archiving a driver fails if any member is not completed
- [x] Archiving a member directly still works (independent of driver)
- [x] Update/remove tests that reference `--include-members`
- [x] All tests pass
