# Fix formatters test to account for counts section

## Summary

The fix was already implemented in commit eb15829. The test `test_format_regular_status_empty`
in `src/formatters.rs:261` was updated to properly distinguish between:
- The counts section (which includes "In Progress:" as a label)
- Section headers (which would be "In Progress\n───────────")

The test now correctly validates that the counts section appears without section headers
for empty status data.

All tests pass.
