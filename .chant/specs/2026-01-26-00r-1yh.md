# Remove parallel limit warnings, add docs reference

## Context

The config validate command was warning about parallel limits (total_max vs agent sums) but we don't have real data on what these limits should be. The numbers are speculative.

Instead of warning, show the config as informational and point users to documentation.

## Changes

1. Change `validate_parallel_limits` to `show_parallel_config` - informational only
2. Display with info icon (ℹ) instead of warning
3. Reference `docs/reference/config.md#parallel-execution` for explanation
4. Add tuning guidance to existing parallel docs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] No warnings for parallel limit configuration
- [x] Shows parallel config with docs reference
- [x] docs/reference/config.md explains limit purpose and tuning
- [x] Tests pass
