# Add archive command to move completed specs to archive folder

## Problem

Over time, `.chant/specs/` accumulates many completed specs, making it hard to see what's active. Need a way to archive completed specs.

## Solution

Add `chant archive` command that moves completed specs to `.chant/archive/` folder.

## Commands

```bash
# Archive all completed specs
chant archive

# Archive specific spec
chant archive <spec-id>

# Archive specs older than N days
chant archive --older-than 7

# Dry run - show what would be archived
chant archive --dry-run
```

## Behavior

1. Create `.chant/archive/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Move spec files from `.chant/specs/` to `.chant/archive/`
3. Preserve the filename
4. Only archive specs with `status: completed` (unless `--force`)
5. Print summary of archived specs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `archive` subcommand to CLI
- [x] Create `.chant/archive/` directory on first archive
- [x] Move completed spec files to archive folder
- [x] Add `--dry-run` flag to preview without moving
- [x] Add `--older-than N` flag to filter by days since completion
- [x] Add `--force` flag to archive non-completed specs
- [x] Print count of archived specs
- [x] Don't archive group specs if members are still active
- [ ] Add `.chant/archive/` to default .gitignore (optional - user choice)
- [x] Add test for archive command
