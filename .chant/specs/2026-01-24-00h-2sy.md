# Append agent conversation to spec after completion

After the agent completes, append the agent's output/conversation to the spec file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Capture agent stdout during execution
- [x] After completion, append output under a `## Agent Output` section
- [x] Include timestamp of when the work was done
- [x] Truncate if output is very long (>5000 chars) with a note

## Implementation Notes

- The agent output is already being streamed to stdout
- Also capture it into a String buffer
- After successful completion, append to spec body before saving
- Format: `## Agent Output\n\n<timestamp>\n\n<output>`
