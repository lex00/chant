# Remove stale config fields from .chant/config.md

The 'pr: false' field in defaults: section does nothing:
- Not in DefaultsConfig struct
- Not in SpecFrontmatter struct  
- Not accessed anywhere in code
- Only appears in test fixtures

Remove it from:
- .chant/config.md
- Example configs in documentation
- Test fixtures (mark as legacy in tests that need it)

Also audit for other stale config fields:
- Check DefaultsConfig struct vs actual config
- Check if all config fields are documented
- Check if all documented fields are implemented
- Ensure config.md matches reality
