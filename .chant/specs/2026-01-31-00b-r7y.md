# Auto-commit on archive to keep git status clean

## Problem

After `chant archive` moves a completed spec to the archive directory, the git status shows untracked/modified files. Users must manually commit these changes.

## Solution

Auto-commit spec file changes after archive operation completes successfully.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] After successful archive, auto-commit the moved spec file
- [x] Commit message format: `chant: Archive {spec-id}`
- [x] Only commit if archive succeeded (don't commit on error)
- [x] Skip commit if working directory has other uncommitted changes (warn user instead)
