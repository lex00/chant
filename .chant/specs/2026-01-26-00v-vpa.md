# Support multiple spec IDs in chant work command

## Context

Currently `chant work` only accepts a single spec ID or `--parallel` (all ready specs). Users need to run a specific subset of specs in parallel.

## Current Behavior

```bash
chant work 00e-94e 00i-939 00j-bfs  # Error: unexpected argument
chant work --parallel                # Runs ALL ready specs
```

## Desired Behavior

```bash
# Run specific specs in parallel
chant work 00e-94e 00i-939 00j-bfs --parallel

# Run specific specs sequentially (one after another)
chant work 00e-94e 00i-939 00j-bfs
```

## Implementation

1. Change `[ID]` argument to accept multiple values: `[ID]...`
2. If multiple IDs + `--parallel`: run them in parallel
3. If multiple IDs without `--parallel`: run sequentially (not implemented - falls back to single)
4. If no IDs + `--parallel`: existing behavior (all ready specs)
5. If single ID: existing behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `chant work ID1 ID2 ID3 --parallel` runs specific specs in parallel
- [ ] `chant work ID1 ID2 ID3` runs specs sequentially
- [x] `chant work --parallel` still runs all ready specs
- [x] `chant work ID` still works for single spec
- [x] Partial ID matching works for all IDs
- [ ] Tests for multi-spec execution
