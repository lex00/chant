# Fix blocked status filter returning 0 results

## Problem

The `--status blocked` filter in `chant list` returns 0 results even when many specs are blocked. This suggests the filter logic is broken or not properly implemented.

## Solution

1. Investigate the current blocked status filter implementation in the list command
2. Identify why it's not returning blocked specs
3. Fix the filter logic to properly detect and return blocked specs
4. Add comprehensive tests to verify the filter works correctly with various blocked spec scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Blocked status filter correctly identifies specs with `status: blocked`
- [x] Tests added for blocked filter with multiple blocked specs
- [x] Tests added for edge cases (no blocked specs, all specs blocked, mixed statuses)
- [x] `chant list --status blocked` returns expected results in test scenarios
- [x] All existing tests still pass
