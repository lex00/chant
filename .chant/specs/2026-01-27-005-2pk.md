# Update CLAUDE.md with verify, replay, and other v0.2.0 features

Update the CLAUDE.md file to document new commands and features added in v0.2.0 development.

## New Commands to Document

### Autonomy Commands
```bash
just chant verify [ID]         # Verify acceptance criteria still pass
just chant verify --all        # Verify all completed specs
just chant replay <ID>         # Re-execute a completed spec
just chant replay <ID> --yes   # Skip confirmation
```

### Other Recent Commands
```bash
just chant cancel <ID>         # Soft-delete a spec (status → cancelled)
just chant export              # Interactive export wizard
just chant export --format json --output file.json
just chant config --validate   # Validate configuration
```

## Features to Document

### Non-TTY Behavior
- Merge/delete/cancel auto-proceed without prompting in non-interactive contexts
- Useful for agents running in worktrees

### Spec Statuses
- `Blocked` - Auto-applied when dependencies unmet
- `Cancelled` - Soft-deleted specs

### Agent Rotation
```yaml
parallel:
  rotation_strategy: round-robin  # none, random, round-robin
```

### Auto-lint After Split
- `chant split` now runs lint on created member specs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Autonomy commands (verify, replay) documented in Core Commands section
- [x] Cancel and export commands documented
- [x] Non-TTY behavior noted where relevant
- [x] Agent rotation documented in config section
- [x] New spec statuses documented
