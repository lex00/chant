# Enterprise TDD workflow guide for Acme SaaS Corp

## Problem

Teams need a concrete example showing how chant improves Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow in a multi-team enterprise environment. The guide should:

- **Use same fictional company** (Acme SaaS Corp) from the KPI/OKR guide
- **Show realistic TDD challenges** at scale (inconsistency, drift, coverage gaps, slow test writing)
- **Demonstrate chant integration** without changing existing workflow
- **Multi-page walkthrough** with concrete artifacts
- **High-level abstract overview** with just enough detail to be believable

Currently, the enterprise docs lack a TDD-specific workflow example showing how chant's spec-driven approach naturally aligns with test-driven development.

## Solution

Create a multi-page guide in `docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/` showing how Acme SaaS Corp uses chant to improve TDD across 3 product teams.

### Scenario: Acme SaaS Corp TDD Challenges

**Company Context:**
- Same company as KPI/OKR guide (B2B SaaS platform, 5,000 customers)
- 3 product teams: Auth, Payments, Analytics
- 15 engineers total
- Inconsistent test quality and coverage
- Tests often written after code (not TDD)
- Test drift (tests don't match current behavior)

**TDD Problems:**
1. **Inconsistent test coverage** - Team A: 85%, Team B: 45%, Team C: 92%
2. **Missing edge cases** - Critical paths tested, edge cases forgotten
3. **Flaky tests** - 12% of tests fail intermittently
4. **Test drift** - 23% of tests out of sync with current behavior
5. **Slow test writing** - Bottleneck in development cycle
6. **Poor test documentation** - Hard to understand what tests cover

### Multi-Page Structure

**`README.md`** - Overview and navigation
- Acme's TDD challenges at scale
- How chant helps without changing workflow
- Links to each phase

**`01-scenario.md`** - The TDD Challenge
- 3 product teams with different practices
- Current test metrics (coverage, flakiness, drift)
- Pain points: inconsistency, missing cases, drift
- Engineering leadership goals

**`02-integration.md`** - Chant Meets TDD
- How spec-driven development aligns with TDD
- Specs as test plans (acceptance criteria = test cases)
- Workflow: spec → tests → code (true TDD)
- No process changes required

**`03-test-planning.md`** - Specs as Test Plans
- Create spec with acceptance criteria (each = test case)
- Research specs to analyze test coverage gaps
- Driver specs to organize large test suites
- Example: Payment processing feature with 8 test cases
- Concrete artifact: spec with acceptance criteria

**`04-execution.md`** - Writing Tests with Chant
- `chant work <spec>` - Agent writes tests first
- Parallel execution for multiple test files
- Example: Agent writes pytest tests for all 8 cases
- Concrete artifact: Generated test file

**`05-consistency.md`** - Ensuring Quality Across Teams
- Config templates enforce test structure
- Required fields: `target_files`, `test_coverage`
- Lint validation ensures standards
- Example: All teams use same test patterns

**`06-drift-detection.md`** - Keeping Tests Current
- Documentation specs track test behavior
- `chant drift` detects outdated test docs
- Example: API changes trigger test updates
- Concrete artifact: Drift detection output

**`artifacts/`** - Example Files
- Complete spec files (test planning)
- Generated test code (pytest/jest examples)
- Config templates (test standards)
- Drift detection reports

### Style Guidelines

- **High-level abstract overview** - Not a tutorial, shows it's real without excessive detail
- Use realistic but fictional data (test counts, coverage %, team names)
- Show key command examples and artifacts
- Include just enough to demonstrate the pattern
- Focus on workflow flow, not implementation details
- Balance: Concrete enough to be believable, abstract enough to stay high-level
