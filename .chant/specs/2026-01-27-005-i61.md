# Bundle standard prompts into binary and create on init

## Problem

The bootstrap prompt (and other standard prompts) are only available in this repo's `.chant/prompts/` directory. When users run `chant init`, they don't get these prompts - so the default "bootstrap" prompt doesn't exist for them.

## Solution

1. Create `src/prompts.rs` module that embeds all standard prompts using `include_str!`
2. Move prompts from `.chant/prompts/` to `prompts/` at repo root (for embedding)
3. Update `chant init` to create `.chant/prompts/` directory and write all bundled prompts

Prompts to bundle:
- bootstrap.md (default)
- standard.md
- split.md
- verify.md
- documentation.md
- research-analysis.md
- research-synthesis.md
- doc-audit.md
- merge-conflict.md
- parallel-cleanup.md
- ollama.md

## Additional Requirements

- Must work on already-initialized projects (upgrade path)
- Add `chant init prompts` subcommand to install/update prompts on existing projects
- Or have `chant init` detect existing .chant and only add missing prompts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prompts moved to `prompts/` directory at repo root
- [ ] `src/prompts.rs` module embeds all prompts via `include_str!`
- [ ] `chant init` creates `.chant/prompts/` and writes all bundled prompts
- [ ] `chant init prompts` or similar works on already-initialized projects
- [ ] Existing prompts are NOT overwritten (preserve user customizations)
- [ ] `just lint` passes
- [ ] `just test` passes
