# Fail chant work if spec dependencies not met

## Problem

Currently `chant work` doesn't check if a spec's dependencies are satisfied. If spec B depends on spec A, working B before A completes could cause issues.

## Solution

Before starting work on a spec, verify:
1. All specs in `depends_on` list are completed
2. For member specs, verify driver is at least `in_progress`
3. For member specs, verify prior siblings are completed (e.g., can't work .3 until .1 and .2 done)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Check `depends_on` field - all listed specs must be `completed`
- [x] Member specs: prior siblings must be completed (.1 before .2)
- [x] Show clear error listing which dependencies are blocking
- [x] Add `--force` flag to bypass dependency check
- [x] Add test for dependency validation
