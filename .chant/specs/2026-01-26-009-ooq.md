# Enhance spec documentation to cover all spec types

Update documentation with clear examples and consistent presentation for all spec types.

## Issues to Fix

1. **spec-types.md** says "Status: Planned" but documentation/research types ARE implemented
2. **spec-types.md** is missing task, driver, and group types
3. **specs.md** lacks a clear "Spec Types" quick reference section
4. Prompts section says "Not yet created" but they exist now

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove "Status: Planned" from spec-types.md (feature is implemented)
- [x] Add task, driver, and group types to spec-types.md
- [x] Update prompts status to show they exist
- [x] Add quick reference "Spec Types" section to specs.md
- [x] Ensure consistent example format across all types
- [x] All 6 types documented: code, task, driver, group, documentation, research
