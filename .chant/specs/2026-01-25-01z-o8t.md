# Audit CLAUDE.md to understand why agent incorrectly used plan mode during spec execution

## Problem

During parallel spec execution, the agent working on `01l-y81` (Document MCP error codes) incorrectly tried to use `ExitPlanMode` instead of doing the actual work. It got stuck in a loop calling `ExitPlanMode` repeatedly.

This suggests CLAUDE.md may have confusing instructions that led the agent to think it should plan instead of execute.

## Investigation

1. Read CLAUDE.md and identify any language that could be misinterpreted
2. Check if there are instructions about planning that conflict with spec execution
3. Look for references to plan mode that might trigger incorrect behavior
4. Compare with successful spec executions to identify the difference

## Deliverable

Document findings and recommend fixes (separate spec for actual fixes).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Identified root cause of plan mode confusion
- [ ] Documented problematic sections of CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Recommendations for fixes provided
