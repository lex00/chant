# Standardize spec frontmatter formatting

Ensure all spec files use consistent frontmatter field ordering.

### Inherited Context

- Specs must remain executable by chant CLI
- Frontmatter structure affects spec relationships

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All specs use field order: type, status, prompt, depends_on, informed_by, target_files
- [x] Fields not present in a spec are omitted (not left blank)
- [x] Array fields (depends_on, informed_by, target_files) use consistent YAML list syntax
- [x] All 19 total specs across 5 examples updated

### Edge Cases

- Specs with no dependencies: Omit depends_on/informed_by fields entirely
- Driver specs: Ensure members list is preserved (not in standard field order)
- Specs with multiple dependencies: Maintain dependency relationships accurately

### Example Test Cases

Verify frontmatter structure:
- Independent spec: Has type, status, prompt (no depends_on)
- Member spec: Has type, status, prompt, depends_on (references driver)
- Driver spec: Has type, status, prompt, members list
