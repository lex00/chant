I'll help you prepare the v0.1.0 release for chant. Let me start by creating a todo list to track the tasks and understanding the current state of the project.
Now let me read the current Cargo.toml and README to understand the project's state:
Good! The version is already set to 0.1.0 and basic metadata is present. Let me mark the first task as complete and check the other files:
Let me check if there's a CHANGELOG.md and review the git log to understand what features are in v0.1.0:
Now let me check the docs to understand the full feature set and then run the checks:
