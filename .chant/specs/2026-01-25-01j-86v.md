# Update homebrew formula for v0.1.6 release

## Task

Once GitHub Actions completes the v0.1.6 release build, update the homebrew formula with new SHA256 hashes.

## Steps

1. Wait for GitHub Actions Release workflow to complete
2. Download SHA256 hashes from release assets:
   ```bash
   gh release view v0.1.6 --json assets -q '.assets[].name'
   ```
3. Get the SHA256 for each platform:
   - `chant-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
   - `chant-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
   - `chant-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
   - `chant-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

4. Update homebrew formula at `homebrew-chant/Formula/chant.rb`:
   - Update version to "0.1.6"
   - Update SHA256 hashes for each platform

5. Push changes to homebrew-chant repo

6. Verify: `brew upgrade chant` or `brew install chant-dev/chant/chant`
