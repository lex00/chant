# Refactor chain.rs to use executor.rs shared functions

## Context

`src/cmd/work/executor.rs` has shared functions. After spec 00i, `single.rs` will be using them. This spec does the same for `chain.rs`.

## Task

Refactor `chain.rs` (currently ~800 LOC) to delegate to `executor.rs` shared functions. `chain.rs` should only contain:
- Sequential spec iteration (pick next ready spec)
- Chain-mode reporting (which spec is next, chain progress)
- Loop control (stop on failure, continue to next)

All validation, agent invocation, commit collection, finalization, and error handling should route through the same executor functions that single.rs uses.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `chain.rs` is under 200 LOC
- [ ] `chain.rs` calls the same executor functions as `single.rs`
- [ ] AC handling follows the same policy as single mode
- [ ] Finalization failure sets the same status as single mode
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] `cargo clippy` passes
