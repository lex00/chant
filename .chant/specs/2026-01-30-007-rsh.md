# Document worktree status command and environment variables

Recent commits added worktree features that need documentation:
- `chant worktree status` command (commit dbf33c9)
- Worktree environment variables for agents (commit cb05c3e)
- Worktree context in prompts (commit 3ba80e8)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add "## Worktree" section to `docs/reference/cli.md` documenting `chant worktree status` command
- [x] Document command output format (Path, Branch, HEAD, Size, Age columns)
- [x] Document environment variables (`CHANT_WORKTREE`, `CHANT_WORKTREE_PATH`, `CHANT_BRANCH`) set when agents run in worktrees
- [x] Update `docs/scale/isolation.md` to mention the `chant worktree status` command for inspecting active worktrees
