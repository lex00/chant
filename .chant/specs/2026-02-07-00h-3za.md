# Incorporate agent field feedback into OSS maintainer workflow

## Source

Direct feedback from an agent after running the workflow on two real issues (EventKind fix and dirty buffer suppression). The agent found the workflow effective overall but identified three concrete friction points.

## Feedback 1: Collapsible research stages

**Problem:** Stages 2 (Reproducibility) and 3 (Root Cause) blur together for simple fixes. When the fix is already known, forcing them into separate specs adds ceremony without insight. Quote: "For a simple fix, 'reproducibility' and 'root cause' are basically the same investigation."

**Fix:** Add guidance for collapsing research stages when the problem is well-understood. The workflow should distinguish between "genuine unknown" investigations (keep all stages) and "known fix, need validation" cases (collapse stages 2-3 into a single research spec). This could be a decision point after stage 1 (Comprehension): "If root cause is already apparent, combine Reproducibility and Root Cause into a single Research stage."

## Feedback 2: PR template front-loads user impact

**Problem:** The fork PR review loop took several iterations because the PR body was missing "what does the user see" and "how does this relate to the parent issue." These should be prompted from the start, not discovered during review.

**Fix:** Update the PR body template/guidance in the workflow to require:
1. **User impact** section up front ("What does the user see before/after this change?")
2. **Parent context** section ("How does this PR relate to the umbrella issue?")
3. These should be explicit fields, not afterthoughts

## Feedback 3: Incremental research doc updates

**Problem:** The agent updated the research doc at the end of the investigation instead of as findings emerged. Quote: "Should be incremental."

**Fix:** Add explicit guidance that the research doc (the spec body itself, or a linked doc) should be updated at each stage as findings emerge, not retroactively. This keeps the paper trail accurate and helps the next stage build on documented findings rather than relying on context window memory.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow includes decision point after Comprehension for collapsing stages 2-3 when root cause is already apparent
- [ ] PR body guidance includes "User Impact" and "Parent Context" as required sections
- [ ] Workflow explicitly states research docs should be updated incrementally at each stage
- [ ] Changes are consistent with existing workflow structure (stages, exit criteria pattern)
