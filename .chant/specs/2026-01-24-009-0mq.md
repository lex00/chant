# Add --label filter to list command

Add a `--label` flag to the `list` command to filter specs by label.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `--label` option to List command (can be specified multiple times)
- [x] Filter specs to only show those that have at least one of the specified labels
- [x] Labels are stored in the spec frontmatter `labels` field
- [x] Example: `chant list --label auth --label feature` shows specs with either label

## Implementation Notes

- The `labels` field already exists in SpecFrontmatter as `Option<Vec<String>>`
- Filter after loading all specs
- If multiple labels are specified, show specs matching ANY of them (OR logic)
