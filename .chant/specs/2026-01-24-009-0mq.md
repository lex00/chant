# Add --label filter to list command

Add a `--label` flag to the `list` command to filter specs by label.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `--label` option to List command (can be specified multiple times)
- [x] Filter specs to only show those that have at least one of the specified labels
- [x] Labels are stored in the spec frontmatter `labels` field
- [x] Example: `chant list --label auth --label feature` shows specs with either label

## Implementation Notes

- The `labels` field already exists in SpecFrontmatter as `Option<Vec<String>>`
- Filter after loading all specs
- If multiple labels are specified, show specs matching ANY of them (OR logic)

## Agent Output

```
The spec has been completed. Here's a summary:

**Implementation Summary:**

The `--label` filter for the `list` command was already fully implemented in `src/main.rs`:

1. **`--label` option** (lines 43-44): `#[arg(long)] label: Vec<String>` - supports multiple values
2. **Function signature** (line 255): `fn cmd_list(ready_only: bool, labels: &[String])`
3. **Label filtering** (lines 270-279): Filters specs using OR logic - shows specs with ANY matching label
4. **Empty state messages** (lines 282-287): Updated to handle label filtering in "no specs" messages

I verified the implementation by:
- Building the project successfully
- Checking `chant list --help` shows the `--label` option
- Testing with a temporary spec containing labels (filtering by `auth`, `test`, and multiple labels worked correctly)

**Commit:** `2b3076c chant(2026-01-24-009-0mq): Check off acceptance criteria for --label filter````
