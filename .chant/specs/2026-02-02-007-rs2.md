# Standardize TDD workflow guide to use informed_by consistently

## Output

## Audit Findings

The TDD workflow uses `context:` field where the research-workflow guide uses `informed_by:`. This creates inconsistency.

**Current (03-test-planning.md line 101-102):**
```yaml
context:
  - .chant/context/tdd-standards/coverage-requirements.md
```

**Should be:**
```yaml
informed_by:
  - .chant/context/tdd-standards/coverage-requirements.md
```

## Files to Update

- `docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/03-test-planning.md`
- `docs/guides/enterprise/tdd-workflow/04-execution.md` (if applicable)
- Any other files using `context:` in spec examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `03-test-planning.md` uses `informed_by:` instead of `context:` for research spec example
- [ ] All spec examples in TDD guide consistently use `informed_by:` for input sources
- [ ] Chain from research `target_files:` → code spec `informed_by:` is demonstrated
