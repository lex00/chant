# Fix test-examples.sh to handle research-workflow sub-path structure

## Problem

`research-workflow` example has two sub-paths (academic-path/, developer-path/) each with their own `.chant/` directory. The test script expects a top-level `.chant/specs/` and fails with "No .chant/specs directory in research-workflow".

## Current Structure

```
examples/research-workflow/
├── academic-path/
│   └── .chant/specs/
└── developer-path/
    └── .chant/specs/
```

## Fix

Update `test-examples.sh` to detect and handle multi-path examples:
- If example has sub-directories with `.chant/`, run each sub-path independently
- Run assertions for each sub-path

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `./test-examples.sh research-workflow` runs both academic-path and developer-path
- [x] Script detects sub-path structure automatically
- [x] Each sub-path runs independently with its own chant context
- [x] Assertions run for each sub-path
