# Acceptance Criteria Quality Scoring

Implement scoring for individual acceptance criteria quality.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement `calculate_ac_quality(criteria: &[String]) -> ACQualityGrade` function
- [x] Score each criterion on: phrasing (imperative verb), value (addresses requirement), testability (can verify)
- [x] Imperative verb detection: starts with action words (implement, add, create, verify, etc.)
- [x] Value detection: not meta/admin (avoid "update spec", "add comments")
- [x] Testability: concrete, measurable (avoid "understand", "consider")
- [x] Average individual criterion scores to get overall grade
- [x] Grade A: >90% criteria pass all three checks
- [x] Grade B: >70% criteria pass all three checks
- [x] Grade C: >50% criteria pass all three checks
- [x] Grade D: ≤50% criteria pass

### Edge Cases

- Empty criteria list should return Grade D
- Single criterion that passes all checks should return Grade A
- Criteria with vague verbs ("improve", "enhance") should fail phrasing check

### Example Test Cases

- ["Implement function X", "Add test for Y", "Verify Z works"] → Grade A (all pass)
- ["Update spec", "Consider edge cases", "Improve code"] → Grade D (meta, vague, untestable)
- ["Create endpoint /api/foo", "Update README"] → Grade B (1 passes, 1 is meta)

### Provides

- `calculate_ac_quality(criteria: &[String]) -> ACQualityGrade` - Returns grade based on AC quality
