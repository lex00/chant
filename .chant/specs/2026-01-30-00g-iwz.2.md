# Regular Output Formatter

Implement a formatter that takes `StatusData` and produces the default multi-section text output with counts, today's activity, attention, in-progress, and ready queue.

### Inherited Context

- Output must be human-readable for terminal display
- Follow existing CLI formatting patterns (spacing, headers)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Formatter outputs section headers (Chant Status, Today, Attention, In Progress, Ready)
- [ ] Counts section shows all statuses with aligned numbers
- [ ] Today section shows activity in "+N completed, +N started, +N created" format
- [ ] Attention section shows failed/blocked specs with symbols (✗ for failed, ◌ for blocked)
- [ ] Ready section limited to first 5 with count indicator if >5

### Edge Cases

- No attention items: Omit "Attention" section entirely
- No in-progress items: Omit "In Progress" section
- 0 ready specs: Show "Ready (0)" with no list
- Long spec titles: Truncate to fit terminal width (80 chars)

### Example Test Cases

- Given failed spec "00a-xyz" from 2h ago: Output should include "✗ 00a-xyz  [title] (failed 2h ago)"
- Given 8 ready specs: Output should show first 5 with "Ready (8)" header
- Given 0 attention items: Output should skip "Attention" section
