# Mark driver spec in_progress when member task starts

## Problem

When a member spec (e.g., `01e.1`) starts work, the driver spec (`01e`) should automatically transition from `pending` to `in_progress`.

Currently, driver specs stay `pending` even when their member tasks are being worked on, which doesn't accurately reflect the group's status.

## Behavior

When `chant work <member-id>` is called:
1. Detect if the spec is a member (has a `.N` suffix)
2. Find the driver spec (remove the `.N` suffix)
3. If driver exists and is `pending`, set it to `in_progress`
4. Save the driver spec

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Detect member specs by `.N` suffix pattern (e.g., `01e-o0l.1`)
- [x] Extract driver ID from member ID (e.g., `01e-o0l.1` → `01e-o0l`)
- [x] When member starts work, set driver status to `in_progress` if currently `pending`
- [x] Don't change driver status if already `in_progress` or `completed`
- [x] Save driver spec after status change
- [x] Add test for driver status update when member starts
- [x] Handle case where driver spec doesn't exist (no error, just skip)
