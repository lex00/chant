# Document site command

The `site` command (static site generation) exists in src/main.rs but is not documented in CLI reference or FEATURE_STATUS.md.

## Tasks

1. Read site command definition in src/main.rs (around line 604-665)
2. Document subcommands: `init`, `build`, `serve`
3. Document all flags for each subcommand
4. Add section to `docs/reference/cli.md`
5. Add to FEATURE_STATUS.md command list
6. Add usage examples

## Reference (from main.rs)

```
Site {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: SiteCommands,
}

enum SiteCommands {
    Init { force_overwrite: bool },
    Build { output: Option<PathBuf>, clean: bool },
    Serve { port: u16, open: bool },
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Site command section added to docs/reference/cli.md
- [ ] All subcommands documented (init, build, serve)
- [ ] All flags documented with descriptions
- [ ] At least 1 example per subcommand
- [ ] Added to FEATURE_STATUS.md
