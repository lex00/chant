# Add robust error handling and logging for finalization failures

Enhance error messages when spec save fails or commit detection fails. Add warnings that are visible to the user so finalization problems don't silently go unnoticed. This includes better error context when git operations fail.


## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement as described
- [ ] All tests pass
