# Update homebrew-tap for v0.1.10 release

## Problem

The v0.1.10 release CI failed to update homebrew-tap because the workflow tried to push to `master` instead of `main`. The release binaries are all uploaded to GitHub releases, but the homebrew formula wasn't updated.

## Solution

Manually update the homebrew-tap Formula/chant.rb:

1. Download release assets from v0.1.10
2. Compute SHA256 hashes for each binary
3. Clone homebrew-tap repo
4. Update Formula/chant.rb with new version and hashes
5. Commit and push to main branch

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Download v0.1.10 release assets
- [x] Compute SHA256 hashes
- [x] Update homebrew-tap Formula/chant.rb
- [x] Push to homebrew-tap main branch
- [x] Verify with `brew info lex00/tap/chant`
