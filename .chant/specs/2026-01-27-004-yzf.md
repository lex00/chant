# Audit documentation for coverage of recently added features

Review all documentation files to ensure recently implemented features are properly documented. The roadmap was updated but individual feature docs may be stale.

## Features to Verify Documentation

### Autonomy Layer (v0.2.0)
- [ ] `chant verify` command - CLI reference, concepts
- [ ] `chant replay` command - CLI reference, concepts
- [ ] `chant drift` command - already documented?
- [ ] Verification frontmatter fields (`last_verified`, `verification_status`, `verification_failures`)
- [ ] Replay frontmatter fields (`replayed_at`, `replay_count`, `original_completed_at`)

### Recent Additions
- [ ] `chant cancel` command
- [ ] `chant export` command (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
- [ ] `chant config --validate` command
- [ ] Interactive wizards (search, work, export, merge)
- [ ] Agent rotation strategies (none, random, round-robin)
- [ ] `Blocked` and `Cancelled` spec statuses
- [ ] Non-TTY detection for merge/delete/cancel
- [ ] Auto-lint after split

### Spec Types
- [ ] `documentation` type with `tracks:` field
- [ ] `research` type with `origin:`, `informed_by:`, `schedule:` fields

## Files to Review

- `docs/reference/cli.md` - Command reference
- `docs/concepts/autonomy.md` - Autonomy layer concepts
- `docs/concepts/specs.md` - Spec frontmatter fields
- `docs/concepts/spec-types.md` - Spec type documentation
- `docs/reference/configuration.md` - Config options
- `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` - Already updated

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All new commands documented in CLI reference
- [ ] New frontmatter fields documented in specs concept page
- [ ] Autonomy concepts page reflects actual implementation
- [ ] No "planned" or "not yet implemented" labels on implemented features
- [ ] Examples are accurate and runnable

## Notes

- This is a documentation spec - use `chant drift` to detect future staleness
- Focus on accuracy over completeness - better to document what exists correctly
