# Improve research-workflow spec quality to pass lint checks

## Problem

Both research-workflow specs fail quality check with AC Quality: D:
- `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/specs/001-lit-review.md`
- `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/specs/001-tech-debt.md`

Quality issues prevent execution in non-interactive mode.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rewrite acceptance criteria in both specs to be imperative, valuable, and testable
- [ ] Both specs pass `chant lint` without D grades
- [ ] Specs can execute without `--force` flag
