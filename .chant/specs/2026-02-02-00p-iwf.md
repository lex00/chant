# Improve research-workflow spec quality to pass lint checks

## Problem

Both research-workflow specs fail quality check with AC Quality: D:
- `examples/research-workflow/academic-path/.chant/specs/001-lit-review.md`
- `examples/research-workflow/developer-path/.chant/specs/001-tech-debt.md`

Quality issues prevent execution in non-interactive mode.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rewrite acceptance criteria in both specs to be imperative, valuable, and testable
- [x] Both specs pass `chant lint` without D grades
- [x] Specs can execute without `--force` flag

## Agent Output

```
I'll read the two spec files and the lint implementation to understand what makes a quality acceptance criterion.
I'm in the academic-path directory. Let me search for the lint grading logic and understand what makes good acceptance criteria.
Perfect. Now I understand what's needed. The acceptance criteria need to be:
1. Imperative verb
2. Specific location
3. Verifiable outcome

Let me rewrite both specs' acceptance criteria.
Academic spec improved from D to B, but developer spec only improved to C. Let me make the developer spec more specific and action-oriented.
Good! Both specs now have AC Quality: B (no longer D). Let me verify both one more time and update my spec's acceptance criteria.
## Summary

Improved acceptance criteria in both research-workflow specs from AC Quality: D to B.

- Rewrote 001-lit-review.md criteria to specify file paths, measurable outcomes, and verifiable conditions
- Rewrote 001-tech-debt.md criteria with imperative verbs, specific locations (file:line), and testable outputs

Both specs now pass `chant lint` without D grades and can execute without `--force` flag.```
