# Document model field in spec frontmatter

The `model` field is added to spec frontmatter on completion but is not well documented.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add a "Model Tagging" section to docs/concepts/specs.md
- [ ] Explain what values the `model` field can contain
- [ ] Document how the model is detected (ANTHROPIC_MODEL env var)
- [ ] Explain use cases: cost tracking, debugging model-specific issues
- [ ] Add example showing model in completed spec frontmatter

## Content to Add

```markdown
## Model Tagging

When a spec completes, chant records the AI model used in the frontmatter:

\`\`\`yaml
---
status: completed
commit: abc1234
model: claude-opus-4-5
---
\`\`\`

### How Model is Detected

The model is detected from the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable at execution time.

### Use Cases

- **Cost tracking**: See which models completed which specs
- **Debugging**: Identify model-specific behavior differences
- **Auditing**: Know which AI version produced each change
```
