# Improve documentation at all entry points to guide users toward chant init (no args)

## Problem

Users don't discover the interactive wizard (`chant init` with no args), leading to:
- Confusion about `--provider` vs `--agent` flags
- Missing MCP configuration setup
- Incomplete initialization (skipping agent configuration)
- Not knowing about the wizard's guided experience

The wizard is the best path for new users because it:
- Asks all the right questions in order
- Explains each option with clear prompts
- Automatically creates MCP config when Claude is selected
- Provides sensible defaults
- Prevents configuration mistakes

But it's not well-documented at key entry points where users look for guidance.

## Solution

Update documentation at all entry points to prominently feature the wizard:

### 1. CLI Help Text (`chant --help`)

Current output should highlight the wizard as the recommended path:
```
USAGE:
    chant init                    # Interactive wizard (recommended for first-time setup)
    chant init [OPTIONS]          # Direct configuration
```

### 2. `chant init --help`

Add a prominent note at the top:
```
Initialize a chant project

TIP: Run 'chant init' with no arguments for an interactive setup wizard.
     The wizard will guide you through all configuration options.

USAGE:
    chant init [OPTIONS]
...
```

### 3. README.md Quick Start

Update the Quick Start section to lead with the wizard:
```markdown
## Quick Start

1. **Run the interactive setup wizard:**
   ```bash
   chant init
   ```

   The wizard will guide you through:
   - Project configuration
   - Model provider selection (Claude CLI, Ollama, OpenAI)
   - Default model selection
   - Agent integration (creates CLAUDE.md and .mcp.json automatically)

2. **Create your first spec:**
   ```bash
   chant add "description of work"
   ```

3. **Execute the spec:**
   ```bash
   chant work <spec-id>
   ```
```

### 4. docs/getting-started.md (if exists) or docs/README.md

Add a dedicated "Interactive Setup Wizard" section explaining:
- What the wizard prompts for
- Why it's recommended
- What gets created automatically
- When to use flags instead (CI/CD, scripting)

### 5. Error Message When Running Commands Before Init

When `.chant/` doesn't exist and user runs a command:
```
Error: Not a chant project (no .chant/ directory found)

To initialize chant, run:
    chant init

This will start an interactive wizard to configure your project.
```

### 6. CLAUDE.md (Orchestrator Instructions)

Update the init command documentation to emphasize the wizard:
```markdown
## Initialization

**Recommended: Interactive Wizard**
```bash
chant init
```
Guides through all setup options including agent configuration and MCP integration.

**Direct Configuration (for scripts/automation)**
```bash
chant init --agent claude --provider claude --model opus
```
```

### 7. templates/agent-claude.md (for implementer agents)

Add guidance for when agents need to initialize projects:
```markdown
## Project Initialization

When starting a new chant project, use the interactive wizard:
```bash
chant init
```

The wizard handles all configuration including MCP integration.
```

## Entry Points to Update

1. **src/main.rs** - `chant --help` output and `chant init --help`
2. **README.md** - Quick Start section
3. **docs/** - Getting started guide
4. **CLAUDE.md** - Orchestrator initialization instructions
5. **templates/agent-claude.md** - Implementer initialization guidance
6. **Error messages** - When running commands before init

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `chant init --help` has prominent TIP about running with no args
- [x] `chant --help` shows `chant init` (no args) as recommended for setup
- [x] README.md Quick Start leads with interactive wizard
- [x] Error message when running commands without `.chant/` mentions wizard
- [x] CLAUDE.md has section emphasizing wizard for initialization
- [x] templates/agent-claude.md has wizard guidance
- [x] docs/ has dedicated section on interactive wizard (if docs exist)
- [x] All documentation is consistent in recommending wizard first
- [x] Documentation explains what the wizard creates (including MCP config)

## Non-Goals

- Changing the actual wizard behavior (just documentation)
- Forcing users to use the wizard (flags still work)
- Auto-detection of environment (keep wizard as explicit choice)
