# Improve documentation at all entry points to guide users toward chant init (no args)

## Problem

Users don't discover the interactive wizard (`chant init` with no args), leading to:
- Confusion about `--provider` vs `--agent` flags
- Missing MCP configuration setup
- Incomplete initialization (skipping agent configuration)
- Not knowing about the wizard's guided experience

The wizard is the best path for new users because it:
- Asks all the right questions in order
- Explains each option with clear prompts
- Automatically creates MCP config when Claude is selected
- Provides sensible defaults
- Prevents configuration mistakes

But it's not well-documented at key entry points where users look for guidance.

## Solution

Update documentation at all entry points to prominently feature the wizard:

### 1. CLI Help Text (`chant --help`)

Current output should highlight the wizard as the recommended path:
```
USAGE:
    chant init                    # Interactive wizard (recommended for first-time setup)
    chant init [OPTIONS]          # Direct configuration
```

### 2. `chant init --help`

Add a prominent note at the top:
```
Initialize a chant project

TIP: Run 'chant init' with no arguments for an interactive setup wizard.
     The wizard will guide you through all configuration options.

USAGE:
    chant init [OPTIONS]
...
```

### 3. README.md Quick Start

Update the Quick Start section to lead with the wizard:
```markdown
## Quick Start

1. **Run the interactive setup wizard:**
   ```bash
   chant init
   ```

   The wizard will guide you through:
   - Project configuration
   - Model provider selection (Claude CLI, Ollama, OpenAI)
   - Default model selection
   - Agent integration (creates CLAUDE.md and .mcp.json automatically)

2. **Create your first spec:**
   ```bash
   chant add "description of work"
   ```

3. **Execute the spec:**
   ```bash
   chant work <spec-id>
   ```
```

### 4. docs/getting-started.md (if exists) or docs/README.md

Add a dedicated "Interactive Setup Wizard" section explaining:
- What the wizard prompts for
- Why it's recommended
- What gets created automatically
- When to use flags instead (CI/CD, scripting)

### 5. Error Message When Running Commands Before Init

When `.chant/` doesn't exist and user runs a command:
```
Error: Not a chant project (no .chant/ directory found)

To initialize chant, run:
    chant init

This will start an interactive wizard to configure your project.
```

### 6. CLAUDE.md (Orchestrator Instructions)

Update the init command documentation to emphasize the wizard:
```markdown
## Initialization

**Recommended: Interactive Wizard**
```bash
chant init
```
Guides through all setup options including agent configuration and MCP integration.

**Direct Configuration (for scripts/automation)**
```bash
chant init --agent claude --provider claude --model opus
```
```

### 7. templates/agent-claude.md (for implementer agents)

Add guidance for when agents need to initialize projects:
```markdown
## Project Initialization

When starting a new chant project, use the interactive wizard:
```bash
chant init
```

The wizard handles all configuration including MCP integration.
```

## Entry Points to Update

1. **src/main.rs** - `chant --help` output and `chant init --help`
2. **README.md** - Quick Start section
3. **docs/** - Getting started guide
4. **CLAUDE.md** - Orchestrator initialization instructions
5. **templates/agent-claude.md** - Implementer initialization guidance
6. **Error messages** - When running commands before init

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `chant init --help` has prominent TIP about running with no args
- [x] `chant --help` shows `chant init` (no args) as recommended for setup
- [x] README.md Quick Start leads with interactive wizard
- [x] Error message when running commands without `.chant/` mentions wizard
- [x] CLAUDE.md has section emphasizing wizard for initialization
- [x] templates/agent-claude.md has wizard guidance
- [x] docs/ has dedicated section on interactive wizard (if docs exist)
- [x] All documentation is consistent in recommending wizard first
- [x] Documentation explains what the wizard creates (including MCP config)

## Non-Goals

- Changing the actual wizard behavior (just documentation)
- Forcing users to use the wizard (flags still work)
- Auto-detection of environment (keep wizard as explicit choice)

## Agent Output

```
I'll start by reading the spec file and understanding the current state of the codebase to implement these documentation improvements.
Now let me read the templates file and explore the CLI code to understand how the help text is generated.
Let me read the main CLI code to understand how help text is structured.
Now let me read the quickstart docs and the init.md reference to understand what's already documented.
Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me make the documentation improvements. I'll start with the CLI help text in the Rust code.
Now let me update the error message in `ensure_initialized` function in cmd/mod.rs:
Now let me update README.md to lead with the interactive wizard:
Now let me update CLAUDE.md to add an initialization section that emphasizes the wizard:
I need to find a good location to add an Initialization section in CLAUDE.md. Let me look at the structure more:
I'll add an Initialization section right before the "Primary Rules" section since that's a logical place for first-time setup guidance:
Now let me update templates/agent-claude.md with wizard guidance. Let me first check the structure:
Now let me update the docs/ with a dedicated section on the interactive wizard. The best places are:
1. docs/getting-started/quickstart.md 
2. docs/reference/init.md
Now let me update the docs/reference/init.md with more detail about the wizard:
Now let me verify all documentation is consistent and check if there are any other places that mention init. Let me search for places that might need updating:
Let me check docs/reference/cli.md since it seems to have more init documentation:
The docs/reference/cli.md is already in good shape with wizard documentation. Let me now update it to add information about what the wizard creates (including MCP config) to be consistent:
Now let me check docs/reference/mcp.md to see if it mentions the wizard for MCP setup:
The MCP docs only mention `chant init` in an error context. Let me check if there's a setup section at the top:
The MCP docs need a setup section mentioning that the wizard creates .mcp.json automatically. Let me add that:
Now let me check the installation docs:
The installation docs are already brief and appropriate. Now let me run cargo fmt, clippy, and tests:
There are two pre-existing issues that aren't related to my changes (the function arguments issue was already there, and the dead code issue in commits.rs is unrelated). Let me check if these errors existed before my changes by looking at the cmd_init function signature:
My changes are limited and don't introduce the lint issues. Let me verify that these issues exist on the main branch (before my changes):
The clippy errors exist on the main branch before my changes. Let me restore my changes:
The pre-existing clippy errors are not from my changes. The spec instructions say to run `cargo clippy`, but since these errors existed before my changes and are not related to this spec, I should proceed. Let me at least run the tests:
All tests pass. Now let me update the spec file to mark the acceptance criteria as complete and add the model:
Now let me commit the changes:
All tasks are complete. The remaining uncommitted files are other specs that were not part of this task. Let me verify the implementation by building the binary and checking the help output:
The implementation is complete. Let me verify the error message:
All acceptance criteria have been met:

1. ✅ `chant init --help` has prominent TIP about running with no args
2. ✅ `chant --help` shows `chant init` (no args) as recommended for setup (GETTING STARTED section)
3. ✅ README.md Quick Start leads with interactive wizard
4. ✅ Error message when running commands without `.chant/` mentions wizard
5. ✅ CLAUDE.md has section emphasizing wizard for initialization
6. ✅ templates/agent-claude.md has wizard guidance
7. ✅ docs/ has dedicated section on interactive wizard (quickstart.md, init.md, cli.md, mcp.md)
8. ✅ All documentation is consistent in recommending wizard first
9. ✅ Documentation explains what the wizard creates (including MCP config)```
