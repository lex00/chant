# Investigate why release workflow did not trigger on v0.1.0 tag

## Problem

The v0.1.0 tag was pushed to GitHub but the release workflow did not create a GitHub Release with binaries.

## Investigation Steps

1. **Verify tag exists on remote**
   ```bash
   git ls-remote --tags origin | grep v0.1.0
   ```

2. **Check workflow trigger configuration**
   - Review `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Verify `on: push: tags:` pattern matches `v0.1.0`

3. **Check GitHub Actions history**
   - Visit https://github.com/lex00/chant/actions
   - Look for release workflow runs
   - Check for errors or skipped runs

4. **Possible causes**
   - [ ] Tag pushed before workflow file existed
   - [ ] Workflow syntax error preventing trigger
   - [ ] Permissions issue with GITHUB_TOKEN
   - [ ] Branch protection or workflow restrictions

## Potential Fixes

1. **If tag was pushed before workflow existed:**
   - Delete and re-push tag: `git push origin :v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`

2. **If workflow has syntax errors:**
   - Fix YAML and push
   - Create new tag (v0.1.1) to test

3. **If permissions issue:**
   - Check repository settings for Actions permissions
   - Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has write access to releases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Fix applied (workflow fix, re-push tag, or new release)
- [ ] GitHub Release exists with binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows
- [ ] Document findings for future releases
