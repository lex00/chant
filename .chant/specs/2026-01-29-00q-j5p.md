# Audit documentation accuracy for recently added features

## Problem

Multiple features were added in recent specs:
- Provider and model configuration (`--provider`, `--model` flags)
- MCP auto-configuration (global `~/.claude/mcp.json`)
- Expanded MCP tools (3 → 13 tools)
- Approval requirements in blocking logic
- Documentation improvements for wizard

Documentation may be incomplete, inconsistent, or outdated for these features.

## Recent Features to Audit

### 1. Init Provider/Model Configuration (spec 9pi)
**Added:**
- `--provider <PROVIDER>` flag
- `--model <MODEL>` flag
- Interactive wizard prompts for provider and model
- Surgical config updates on re-run

**Docs to check:**
- `chant init --help` text
- README.md Quick Start
- docs/reference/init.md
- docs/reference/cli.md
- CLAUDE.md

### 2. MCP Auto-Configuration (spec u5r, 7ir)
**Added:**
- Auto-creation of `.mcp.json` when `--agent claude` is used
- 13 MCP tools (expanded from 3)
- Global config write to `~/.claude/mcp.json`
- Smart merging with existing MCP servers

**Docs to check:**
- docs/reference/mcp.md
- CLAUDE.md MCP Integration section
- templates/agent-claude.md
- README.md (if mentions MCP)

### 3. Approval Blocking Logic (spec 8s1)
**Added:**
- Pending specs with required approval show in `--status blocked`
- Merge blocks unapproved specs
- Cancel/delete allow regardless of approval

**Docs to check:**
- docs/reference/cli.md (list command, filters)
- CLAUDE.md (approval workflow)

### 4. Documentation Improvements (spec 3cf)
**Added:**
- Wizard guidance in multiple places
- Error messages updated
- Consistent messaging about wizard

**Docs to verify:**
- All changes are accurate
- No outdated references
- Wizard behavior matches docs
