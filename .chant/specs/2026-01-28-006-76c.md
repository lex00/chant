# Roadmap should not be historical - move implemented features to main docs

## Problem

The roadmap documentation (`docs/roadmap/roadmap.md`) contains historical information about features that have already been implemented. Roadmaps should only reference future planned features, not past accomplishments.

Implemented features should be documented in the main docs (guides, reference, concepts) where users can actually learn how to use them.

## Solution

Audit the roadmap documentation and:
1. Identify any references to implemented features
2. Move documentation for implemented features to appropriate locations in main docs
3. Remove historical/implemented feature references from roadmap
4. Ensure roadmap only contains planned/future features

This ensures:
- Roadmap is forward-looking only
- Implemented features are findable in main documentation
- No confusion about what's available vs. what's planned

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Read `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` and identify all implemented features
- [x] For each implemented feature, determine if it has adequate documentation in main docs
- [x] Move or add documentation for implemented features to appropriate main doc locations
- [x] Remove all historical/implemented feature references from roadmap
- [x] Verify roadmap only references planned features
- [x] Update any cross-references or navigation links
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Code linted and formatted

I'll start by reading the relevant files to understand the current state of the roadmap and documentation structure.
Now I have a thorough understanding of both the roadmap and the docs structure. Let me also check the SUMMARY.md to understand the navigation, and read a few key doc files to check what's already documented.
Now I have a thorough understanding of the situation. Let me also read the spec file so I can check off acceptance criteria later, and check what the `git-hooks.md` reference looks like.
Now let me analyze the situation. The roadmap contains extensive historical content about implemented features. Let me identify what needs to move and where:

**Historical/Implemented content in the roadmap that needs removal:**

1. **"What's Designed" table (lines 10-50)** - Lists features with links to existing docs. This is redundant since these features are already documented in their respective locations.

2. **"Architecture Layers" diagram (lines 52-82)** - Shows completion status of layers. Mostly historical (6 of 7 layers complete). The architecture itself is documented in `architecture/architecture.md`.

3. **Layer 0-7 descriptions (lines 84-116)** - Detailed descriptions of each layer with completion status. Architecture docs already cover this.

4. **"Version Roadmap" > "Current Status" table (lines 117-133)** - Phase 0-8 completion status. Historical.

5. **"Upcoming Releases" with released versions (lines 135-144)** - v0.2.0, v0.3.0, v0.3.1 are marked "Released". Only v0.4.0, v0.5.0, v1.0.0 are forward-looking.

6. **"Spec Types (Implemented)" section (lines 146-158)** - Already documented in `concepts/spec-types.md`.

7. **"Implementation Phases" Phase 0-8 sections (lines 160-273)** - Detailed phase histories, all marked COMPLETE or PARTIAL.

8. **"Testing" section (lines 276-288)** - Already in `reference/testing.md`.

9. **"Self-Bootstrap" section (lines 290-367)** - Historical bootstrap narrative.

10. **"Multi-Repo Support" section (lines 369-395)** - Already in `scale/multi-project.md`.

11. **"Self-Improvement Loop" (lines 397-417)** - Historical workflow example.

12. **"Lessons Learned" section (lines 491-533)** - Historical.

Let me check if the architecture doc already has the layer information, and what key content might need to be preserved or moved.
Good. The architecture doc already has a comprehensive layer diagram and the philosophy doc already covers the bootstrap story. Now let me plan precisely what to do:

**Analysis Summary:**

The roadmap has these major sections, and here's the disposition for each:

1. **"Core Principles"** (lines 3-8) - Brief, could stay as design philosophy, but it's already in `philosophy.md`. **Remove.**
2. **"What's Designed" table** (lines 10-50) - A comprehensive index of all features. This is useful as an index but belongs in `FEATURE_STATUS.md`, which already covers this. **Remove.**
3. **"Architecture Layers" diagram** (lines 52-82) - Completion status. Already in `architecture.md`. **Remove.**
4. **Layer descriptions** (lines 84-116) - Already in architecture docs. **Remove.**
5. **"Version Roadmap" table** (lines 117-133) - Phase completion status. Historical. **Remove.**
6. **"Upcoming Releases"** (lines 135-144) - Keep only future items (v0.4.0, v0.5.0, v1.0.0). **Keep future only.**
7. **"Spec Types (Implemented)"** (lines 146-158) - Already in `concepts/spec-types.md`. **Remove.**
8. **Implementation Phases 0-8** (lines 160-273) - Historical. Already documented in respective docs. **Remove.**
9. **"Testing"** (lines 276-288) - Already in `reference/testing.md`. **Remove.**
10. **"Self-Bootstrap"** (lines 290-367) - Bootstrap narrative. Already in `philosophy.md`. **Remove.**
11. **"Multi-Repo Support"** (lines 369-395) - Already in `scale/multi-project.md`. **Remove.**
12. **"Self-Improvement Loop"** (lines 397-417) - Historical/tutorial. **Remove.**
13. **"Non-Goals"** (lines 419-428) - Forward-looking design constraint. **Keep.**
14. **"Competitive Position"** (lines 430-437) - Vision statement. Could stay, but brief enough. **Keep.**
15. **"Future Considerations"** (lines 439-479) - Planned features (Prompt Ecosystem, Wetwire). **Keep.**
16. **"Success Metrics"** (lines 481-489) - Forward-looking targets. **Keep.**
17. **"Lessons Learned"** (lines 491-533) - Historical. Already incorporated. **Remove.** But this is interesting project history — let me check if there's a better home for it.

Before I proceed, let me verify what content from the roadmap might be missing from existing docs. The key content that needs to be moved or verified is:

1. The "What's Designed" table — `FEATURE_STATUS.md` already serves as the definitive index
2. Architecture layers — already in `architecture.md`
3. Phase details — already documented in respective concept/reference/scale docs
4. Bootstrap story — already in `philosophy.md`
5. Multi-repo — already in `scale/multi-project.md`
6. Spec types — already in `concepts/spec-types.md`
