# Roadmap should not be historical - move implemented features to main docs

## Problem

The roadmap documentation (`docs/roadmap/roadmap.md`) contains historical information about features that have already been implemented. Roadmaps should only reference future planned features, not past accomplishments.

Implemented features should be documented in the main docs (guides, reference, concepts) where users can actually learn how to use them.

## Solution

Audit the roadmap documentation and:
1. Identify any references to implemented features
2. Move documentation for implemented features to appropriate locations in main docs
3. Remove historical/implemented feature references from roadmap
4. Ensure roadmap only contains planned/future features

This ensures:
- Roadmap is forward-looking only
- Implemented features are findable in main documentation
- No confusion about what's available vs. what's planned

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Read `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` and identify all implemented features
- [x] For each implemented feature, determine if it has adequate documentation in main docs
- [x] Move or add documentation for implemented features to appropriate main doc locations
- [x] Remove all historical/implemented feature references from roadmap
- [x] Verify roadmap only references planned features
- [x] Update any cross-references or navigation links
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Code linted and formatted
