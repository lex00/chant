# Consolidate approval workflow documentation

Approval workflow is documented in 4 different places, causing redundancy and potential inconsistency:

1. `docs/reference/cli.md` (Approve/Reject section, ~70 lines)
2. `docs/guides/approval-workflow.md` (dedicated guide)
3. `docs/roadmap/planned/approvals.md` (misplaced, claims implemented)
4. `docs/concepts/lifecycle.md` (mentions approval commands)

## Tasks

1. Review all 4 locations for content
2. Choose single authoritative location (likely `docs/guides/approval-workflow.md`)
3. Merge unique content into authoritative location
4. Replace other locations with brief summary + link
5. Delete or archive redundant files
6. Update SUMMARY.md

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single comprehensive approval workflow document
- [ ] CLI reference has brief section linking to guide
- [ ] No duplicate detailed content
- [ ] `docs/roadmap/planned/approvals.md` removed or moved
- [ ] All internal links working
