# Fix test-examples.sh to properly report errors and not claim success on failures

## Problem

Script reports "All examples completed successfully!" even when:
- Specs require approval and can't run
- Specs are rejected and can't run
- Config files are missing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Script tracks individual spec execution failures
- [ ] Script reports which specs failed and why at the end
- [ ] Script exits with non-zero code if any spec failed to execute
- [ ] Expected failures (approval-required, rejected) are noted but don't cause overall failure
- [ ] Unexpected failures (missing config, crashes) cause overall failure
