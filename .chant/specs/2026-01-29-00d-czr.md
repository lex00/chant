# Audit documentation for v0.6.1+ features

SCOPE:
Check documentation coverage and accuracy for these new features:
1. Race condition fix (00a-qza) - branch mode finalization deferred until after merge
2. Chain with specific IDs (00b-li8) - chant work --chain spec1 spec2 spec3
3. Agent approval workflow (00c-78s) - require_approval_for_agent_work config

AUDIT TARGETS:

1. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Are all three features documented in v0.6.1 or Unreleased section?
   - Are breaking changes noted if any?

2. **CLAUDE.md** (agent instructions)
   - Does it mention the new approval workflow for agent work?
   - Does it document the chain behavior with specific IDs?
   - Any outdated instructions about finalization?

3. **README.md**
   - Are new features listed in feature overview?
   - Is chain usage documented with ID examples?
   - Is approval workflow mentioned?

4. **CLI help text** (chant --help, chant work --help, etc.)
   - Does --chain flag explain both behaviors (with/without IDs)?
   - Is approval workflow discoverable?

5. **docs/ directory**
   - Reference docs for approval system
   - Examples of chain usage
   - Branch mode finalization behavior

DELIVERABLE:
Create a comprehensive list of documentation gaps and inaccuracies, then fix them all.
