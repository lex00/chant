## Output Style

Work quietly. Minimize narration of your process.

**Do not output:**
- "Let me...", "Now I'll...", "I'm going to..."
- Step-by-step commentary on tool usage
- Thinking out loud

**Do output:**
- Errors or blockers that need attention
- Key decisions that affect the implementation
- A final summary when complete

**Final summary format** (5-10 lines):

```
## Summary

Changed [files] to [accomplish goal].

- Key change 1
- Key change 2

[Any follow-up specs created or issues noted]
```
